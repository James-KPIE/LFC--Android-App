	<p class="article"><b>MEASURE YOUR PROGRESS</b></p>
    <p class="article">A good start, though necessary, does not guarantee a better end. Your
      starting well does not determine whether you end well. This is why you
      have to measure your progress continually at regular intervals.</p>
    <p class="article">Our dreams and plans need constant and continual revision in order not to
      get both out of mind and out of hand. This is done by constantly
      evaluating your progress at every major junction. You need to frequently
      have a consciousness of where you started from, where you have been, and
      where you are, with respect to where you are going to.</p>
    <p class="article">How far are you supposed to have gone? How far have you gone? What range
      are you supposed to have covered, going by your plans? What range have you
      actually covered? With the goals you set, what should you have achieved as
      at today? What have you physically achieved?</p>
    <p class="article">Answers to these questions will help you to measure your progress. It
      helps you to know how far you have gone, or how far you are behind your
      set goals, and motivates you to adjust and increase the pace at which you
      move. It will enable you to know whether you are on the path to fulfilling
      your dream or aborting it.</p>
    <p class="article">Measure your progress every inch of the way. Record each one of your
      achievements. Disappoint final failure by keeping a track of the past.
      Then build on the accomplishment of the past. Count your small successes.
      Your small successes will add up to a large one and your small failure
      likewise will add up to a great failure. To avoid this fatal failure,
      control the small failures.</p>
    <p class="article">Huge success comes in bits. The smaller things you have accomplished will
      motivate you to accomplish greater things. The more you succeed at the
      smaller units, the more likely you are to assume greater risks and the
      more courageous you are to take the next step in your plan. Keeping the
      memories of the past victories help increase your courage.</p>
    <p class="article">Assess yourself and see how far you have gone. If you are doing well,
      moving at the required and desired rate, do not relax. Keep moving. But if
      you are still lacking behind, buckle up in order to catch up with your
      plans.</p>
    <p class="article">Do not lose your motivation for no reason. Always encourage yourself by
      continually remembering the reason why you started and the achievements
      you have made. Make sure every thoroughly planned, well laid out activity
      is precisely executed, no matter the difficulties faced. Be better today
      than yesterday.</p>
    <p class="article">Every time you are able to accomplish a small part of your dream, give
      yourself a pat on the back. Remind yourself of your success over and over
      again. Tell yourself convincingly that if you can achieve that small goal,
      you can also achieve a greater one with less stress.</p>
    <p class="article">Reward yourself at every major junction. Celebrate each little success
      you make. Plan something special for yourself when you accomplish a set
      goal. Set transitional rewards. Give yourself intermediate incentives. It
      does not have to be expensive but let it be something special, as a token
      of your belief in yourself and in your ability to achieve a set goal.
      However, do not let your success spoil you.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>VISUALIZE THE REWARD</b></p>
    <p class="article">You must have a clear photograph of the future of your dream before you
      every day. This serves as a source of motivation. Each time you refuse to
      see the future of your dream, you will always go back to the past of the
      dream. Looking ahead to the future of your dream will make you accept the
      situation of today with joy and get you excited about its future.</p>
    <p class="article">When you look at the future of your dream, one major thing you will see
      is the reward awaiting you at the end of the road. Each time you remember
      to concentrate on the positive reward you will receive, it will help
      whenever you are tempted by momentary diversions which may tend to slow
      down your progress towards the accomplishment of your dream. No man wants
      to run in vain. Every man who runs a race does so to receive a prize.
      Paul, the great Apostle said he pressed towards the mark of the high
      calling. You also need to press forward with the star prize in mind.</p>
    <p class="article">Visualizing the reward before you always will help increase your
      enthusiasm towards your dream. It propels you towards the place of its
      fulfillment. The prize becomes an inner drive, an impulse that causes you
      to move and act even in the presence of opposition, criticisms and
      attacks. With the end result in mind, problems become opportunities for
      progress, pains are seen as gains and challenges as motivators.</p>
    <p class="article">Without visualizing the reward, you can get easily discouraged, but
      constantly putting the reward on your mind will keep encouraging you to
      continue whenever you feel downcast, enhance your commitment to your
      dream, and give you enough strength to continue in the face of all odds.</p>
    <p class="article">Joseph, the dreamer, placed before him the picture of the throne and his
      brothers bowing down before him and he was able to get there. King David
      kept before him the reward for killing the giant Goliath – great riches
      from the king and his daughter for a wife. With this in mind, he got what
      he wanted - the head of Goliath. Even Jesus, the author and the finisher
      of our faith did not neglect this fact. What kept Him going was His focus
      on the end result. The Great Book says, “...; who for the Joy that was set
      before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the
      right hand of the throne of God”. He was able to endure difficulties and
      despise oppositions because of the joy set before him.</p>
    <p class="article">If Jesus needed to visualize the reward to have a fulfilled dream, then
      you need it the more. It is utter foolishness to pretend not to. It is not
      about being materialistic but about being focused. Learn to envision the
      materialization of the reward. Think about the end result. Concentrate on
      the positive aspect of it and let your mind dwell on it. It will help you
      a lot.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>PRAY</b></p>
    <p class="article">Fulfilling your dream is not funfair but warfare - real warfare in the
      spirit realm, warfare against the true enemy of your dream and every other
      negative factor. This is where prayer comes in.</p>
    <p class="article">Prayer is very important. If you really want to bring God into your
      dream, you have to pray. Prayer is the only divine security you have
      against the assault of the evil one. It is your insurance. The quality of
      your prayer determines the quality of the success of your dream.</p>
    <p class="article">Dreamers are pray-ers. A successful dreamer spends time on his knees. It
      is essential to bring your dream to fruition. It will release you from
      stress, worry, doubts, discouragement and whatever thing that will want to
      rub you of your dream.</p>
    <p class="article">Prayer is a disinfectant. It purifies the atmosphere of your dream and
      makes it uninhabitable for weeds, unwanted plants and contagious demons.
      It levels the mountains before you and fills your valleys. It makes you
      achieve all manners of conquests - demonic, spiritual, intellectual or
      otherwise. It gives you the strength to overcome all the weapons of the
      enemy fashioned against your dream and the forces militating against its</p>
