	<h3 style="text-align: center;"> CHAPTER TWO</h3>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">THIRD-CLASS MATERIALS</h3>
    <p class="article" style="text-align: justify;">Everyone who has ever passed through school
      knows that academic examination is not a true test of oneâ€™s entire
      potential ability; it only favours those with great academic
      strength. If academic is not one of your very strong points, you really
      should have prepared your mind afore-hand for what to expect from the
      finals of your examination in school.</p>
    <p class="article" style="text-align: justify;">There is no problem believing God that a
      miracle which will shoot up your G.P from where it used to be to the
      desired height will happen after the final year examinations. However, if
      the miracle does not happen as you desire it, you need not break your neck
      mourning. Accept it in good faith.</p>
    <p class="article" style="text-align: justify;">At this juncture of your life, what you need
      to do is to sit down and redefine your definition of success. What does it
      mean to be successful?</p>
    <p class="article" style="text-align: justify;">Succeeding in school is not the same as
      succeeding in life; likewise, failing out of school does not necessarily
      mean you have failed in life. A pass mark in school does not guarantee a
      pass mark in life, and a failure in the first does not also guarantee a
      failure in the other. You may have passed out with a third-class result
      now, but this does not make you a third-class material for life.</p>
    <p class="article" style="text-align: justify;">Every student is a first-class material,
      only that the field in which they excel differs. Those who excel in
      academic work are easily noticed and awarded first-class earlier than
      others. But this is not to say others cannot excel in other fields.</p>
    <p class="article" style="text-align: justify;">You also can excel as a first-class material
      in some other fields other than academic. So, do not let anyone write you
      off as a useless third-class material. You carry some value. You have some
      worth. You are important. You have in you what will make other first-class
      materials in the academic field bow down for your ingenuity. God has
      ensured that, and it is left to you to discover it.</p>
    <p class="article" style="text-align: justify;">Today in your school, those who have
      first-class in academic works are being celebrated. But time will tell. In
      not many days from now, if you do what is expected of you, you also will
      be celebrated as a first-class material. It though may not be in the
      academic field, it may be in the entertainment, medical, pharmaceutical,
      production, sport, power, politics, or any other sector. When the time
      comes, those who look down on you today for graduating with a third-class
      will bless God for your life, and will be proud to identify with you.</p>
    <p class="article" style="text-align: justify;">This is the sincere truth, making a
      first-class in school is quite different from making a first-class in
      life. The former is easier than the latter. All it takes to get a
      first-class in school is being smart enough to reproduce verbatim in the
      exam hall what your lecturers told you in the lecture hall.</p>
    <p class="article" style="text-align: justify;">However, making a first-class in life
      requires much more. It takes more discipline, dedication, diligence,
      commitment, focus and lots more to make a first-class in the real
      examination of life. This is why many who graduated with third-class in
      school always cross over the boundary to make first-class in life before
      their death and very few of those who graduated with first-class from the
      higher institutions really have something significant to offer their
      generation at the end of their life. They believe they can always have it
      as easy as they had it in school. What a mistake!</p>
