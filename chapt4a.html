    <h3 style="text-align: center;">LOCATING A FIRST-CLASS DREAM</h3>
    <p class="article">What makes a man great is his ability to locate what his dreams are early
      in life. This is why you need to quit grieving over your past results
      early enough and start creating a future for yourself. The real value of
      life depends on how early dreams and visions are located, pursued and
      accomplished.</p>
    <p class="article">Taking time to lament over what has happened in the past is
      no crime, but when such actions begin to take more time in the present
      than it should, especially to the detriment of the future, then something
      should be done about it on time. Rather than mourn about the past, create
      the future you desire. Work on a dream that can put your name on the list
      of the first class personalities in the world.</p>
    <p class="article">You may not need to begin to pray and fast for a dream again. You
      probably have one already with you right now as you read this book. There
      is one lurking somewhere in your heart which God has intended that will
      take you to the top. Find it out on time.</p>
    <p class="article">The best opportunities in the world are hidden near us but most of us
      fail to recognize them even when they stare openly at us in the face.
      Ideas that would change the tide of events in the world and have ceiling
      impacts on generations to come are what most of us sleep and wake with
      daily without any consciousness of them. We waste the resources of heaven
      on hourly basis and still complain that God is not too fair to us simply
      because we did not make a first-class degree like our mates. What an
      irony!</p>
    <p class="article">Those thoughts, ideas and concepts that cross your mind often, either
      when you were in school with high hopes of a high-paying white collar jobs
      after graduation, or now that you have considered that an illusion,
      considering the degree you graduated with, are dreams in disguise.</p>
    <p class="article">That particular proposal which never seems to leave your mind could be
      your dream. That single purpose in life that is so enjoyable that you are
      eager to carry out, regardless of whether there is a reward or
      compensation, could be your dream. That project in your hand could be your
      dream. That desire in your heart could be your dream. That picture in your
      mind could be your dream. That single thing you pursued while on campus,
      that made you drop from first-class to third-class degree could in a way
      be related to your dream.</p>
    <p class="article">See to it that this dream does not die prematurely. That picture in your
      heart will put your future in your hand. You do not have to be a
      Methuselah before you can have noteworthy impacts. Starting from today,
      you can make every single day of your life count by just one thing - a
      dream. Life is too short to be spent doing irrelevant things. Maximize
      your potentials while you are still young. You do not have to spend an
      eternity on earth before you begin to make waves. Locate your dreams; and
      that quite early. The earlier the better for you!</p>
    <p class="article">There are few things you will need to know about dream as we continue.
      Firstly, do not expect anybody to dream for you; you may be disappointed.
      Dreams are by personal discoveries. You find it out by yourself or else
      you die without realizing it.</p>
    <p class="article">In natural sleep, no man helps another to dream, no matter how closely
      related they are to one another. Every man who wants to dream must go to
      bed for himself, no matter how busy he is. So also, no man can have a
      dream for you. It is something only you can do for yourself.</p>
    <p class="article">People around you will not discover your dream for you. The best they can
      do is to suggest what they think suits you best. They may be right; and
      for all you care, they may also be wrong! Only you can discover what you
      have to do for yourself and now is the best time to do that. There is no
      better time.</p>
