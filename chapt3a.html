    <h3 style="text-align: center;">THE WAY FORWARD</h3>
    <p class="article">Your result has definitely limited you; there is no need denying that
      fact. Your mates with better results will be offered better job
      opportunities with mouth-watering offers. Most of these opportunities may
      likely elude you; but it is still not the end of the world. God has great
      things in stock for you in the future.</p>
    <p class="article">Do not let your certificate intimidate you. Do not be misinformed by your
      result. You cannot afford to miss out on God’s plan for you simply because
      of man’s assessment of you. There is more to your life than
      the degree you carry. You just need to align yourself with destiny.</p>
    <p class="article">At this stage of your life, there is one of two visible options to take:
      You either make a living by force or by wisdom. To make a living by force,
      you have to engage in hard labour, serving others, since you do not have
      the certificate it takes to get a good job and lead others. No one will
      employ a third class student to come and lead first class students.
      However, to make a living by wisdom, all you need is to discover your
      potentials and build a dream future around it.</p>
    <p class="article">Failing once in a while is inevitable in life, but it is convertible, and
      these are the two ways to convert this present failure into success. These
      are the two choices you have to make;</p>
    <p class="article">(1) Either to serve others, or</p>
    <p class="article">(2) To make others serve you.</p>
    <p class="article">Living A First-Class Life With A Third-Class Degree Sam. O. Salau</p>
    <p class="article">To serve others really will not demand anything too serious from you.
      However, if you must be served, then you must discover your potentials and
      build a future around it. This is important because your potential is a
      pointer to your purpose in life.</p>
    <p class="article">There are other possible ways though, through which you can get to the
      top aside the two mentioned above. You can decide to go through it all
      over again so as to make the necessary amendments where you have earlier
      missed it. To do this, you will have to sit for the qualifying examination
      into the higher institution afresh, get readmitted for either the same
      degree or another degree, in either the same school or a different school,
      going through the stress and rigours of schooling as an undergraduate once
      again. Certainly, considering your maturity level, you will be more
      serious with it this time around, and you are most likely to come out with
      a better degree.</p>
    <p class="article">Alternatively, you can go for your Post-Graduate Diploma, after which you
      then go ahead to do your Masters. This will overshadow your first degree
      and reduce the emphasis on it. With the Masters degree, you are likely to
      get a better placement in the society. However, the challenge here is that
      if you do not have a very strong financial backbone, the bill for running
      a Master’s degree can be neck breaking for a jobless third-class graduate
      like you (I do not mean to hurt you; just on a lighter mood).</p>
    <p class="article">Much more than this, by the time you are through with your Masters, you
      will possibly be overqualified for some jobs and under-qualified for
      others. You will just hang in-between the two categories of job seekers.
      Most job descriptions that will fit into your Masters’ degree and age
      specification will require some years of experience, which you cannot
      boast of as at today. So, you will be back to square one. You will have to
      start looking for the right job again!</p>
    <p class="article">If you had chosen the earlier option of going through it all over again,
      you are likely to be older than the generally acceptable employability age
      for fresh graduates, especially in a country like ours where employers do
      not forget to put age restrictions when placing adverts for job offers -
      not more than twenty six years of age, with a minimum of four years’
      experience in relevant fields!</p>
    <p class="article">If you do not want to go through any of these, then you are left with
      only two options: either to accept whatever life brings your way in good
      fate, or you create your own job. Except for supernatural interventions or
      strong earthly connections, you are not likely to get the kind of job you
      want out there with the certificate in your hands, but you can create the
      kind of job you want for yourself; and no one will require that you submit
      your CV for that.</p>
    <p class="article">This kind of job only requires one thing, not your CV, not the school you
      graduated from, not the course you studied, not the degree you graduated
      with, but discovering your purpose, building a future around it, and
      living up to your dream future!</p>
    <p class="article"><b>DISCOVER YOURSELF</b></p>
    <p class="article">Discover your purpose. Discover your dream. Discover your potentials.
      Discover yourself. Do not let someone else’ opinion about you abort your
      destiny. What anyone calls you does not matter, what you answer to makes
      all the difference. You may have failed in school, but if you key into
      your purpose of existence on earth, you can still excel. If you lose your
      head because of this failure, you will not see the glorious end that
      awaits you. To get the best from this failure, rise up to the challenge.</p>
    <p class="article">What everyone should desire in life, even above academic success, worldly
      fame and financial prosperity is the fulfillment of his dreams. This does
      not only come through academic achievements alone; it comes through
      fulfillment of purpose.</p>
