	<h4 style="color:red" align="right">CHAPTER 2: Page 4</h4>
	<p class="article">The society has little or nothing good to offer you that will be of
      benefit to your destiny. Whatever they offer you, they will take back from
      you in some other forms. Nothing goes for nothing!</p>
    <p class="article">It is bad enough that you have made this mistake in time past. You have
      relied on the academic community to treat you with leniency and give you
      the result you desired. However, the society has failed you by giving you
      only what you deserve.</p>
    <p class="article">The school disappointed you. Your lecturers frustrated you. The examiners
      saddened you. The invigilators upset you. Your classmates neglected you to
      your fate. Everybody was hard and harsh on you. Nobody gave you the chance
      to prove that you could do better.</p>
    <p class="article">This is what is obtainable everywhere. It will be more disastrous to fall
      into the same error again. This time, you may never recover from it for
      life! Remember, “only fools repeat mistakes; the wise learns from it”.</p>
    <p class="article">Please, behave wisely. “Once beaten twice shy”. This is the time to take
      your future in your hands and twist it whichever way you want. You may
      have been labelled a failure by everyone around you. However, you are not
      yet what they call you until you admit it. If you resign to fate and
      accept whatever little the world has to offer you, you have already
      admitted you are a failure.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>FORGET THE PAST</b></p>
    <p class="article">What has happened is nothing compared to what can still happen. The past
      is too insignificant to affect the future significantly. What matters is
      not what has gone behind but what lies ahead. If you must make progress,
      you must shut the door on what is behind and look ahead with anticipation
      and hope for the things the future holds.</p>
    <p class="article">This is fundamental; you will need to forget the past and everything that
      is tied to it if you must move forward. If you do not release yourself
      from the grip of the past, you will continually live in it.</p>
    <p class="article">Only single-minded concentration on the future is essential in running
      the race of life. God did not design man to always look backwards in life;
      that is why He did not put any eye at the back of our heads. He placed our
      two eyes in front so that man can always look forward in order to go
      forward. No driver makes continuous progress looking at the side mirror or
      the center mirror which only view his rear. Every driver looks forward to
      move forward; He only looks backward to move backward (reverse).</p>
    <p class="article">So also everyone who wants to make progress must continually look forward
      to go forward in life. If you continually look backward at your third
      class degree, you will only end up moving backward. This is why you have
      to let go off the past completely.</p>
    <p class="article">Letting go of the past may not always be an instant thing for everyone.
      For some, it could be a step-by-step process through which the mind is
      renewed. Whichever is yours, it is possible to shut it behind you and
      continue with life. Learn all you need from it, break out of its mould and
      move into the future God has prepared for you.</p>
    <p class="article">There are four things you will need to consciously forget about the past.
      They are:</p>
