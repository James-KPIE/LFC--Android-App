	<h4 style="color:red" align="right">CHAPTER 4: Page 3</h4>
	<p class="article">If you are sure that God is your partner, make your dream BIG. Do not
      believe the limit where others ended. If you allow your progress to be
      dictated by the extent to which others have gone, then you will be
      limiting God’s move in your life. When you limit God, you are limiting
      your resources. When you limit your resources, you become handicapped.
      When you become handicapped, you cannot move at the rate you desire to
      move, and you eventually become stagnated.</p>
    <p class="article">Your academic ability notwithstanding, enlarge the coast of your dream.
      No matter how big that dream is, it is not bigger than God, and so it is
      not beyond accomplishment if He decides to help you. The only dream that
      is beyond accomplishment is that which is bigger than God and there is no
      such dream. No matter how big the dream is, it cannot intimidate Him. Your
      biggest dream can neither diminish the Almighty God nor exhaust His
      resources.</p>
    <p class="article">When a man sleeps, the things he dreams about are always things that may
      never happen. He becomes things he never really is in real life and he
      does things he may never be able to do if he were awake with his senses
      fully functional! He becomes a ‘superman’. He jumps great heights, runs
      faster than cars, flies over buildings, and carries loads bigger than him
      with ease. He acquires a bigger than nature size. This is the idea of
      dreams. Dreams are limitless. They are things that do not look too real:
      things that may never be possible except in dreams alone.</p>
    <p class="article">You also need such dreams. Although you have a third-class result, you
      can nurse a first-class dream. Do not let your academic inability limit
      your dreams. Dream uncommon dreams. Dream seemingly impossible dreams.
      Dream seemingly unachievable dreams.</p>
    <p class="article">If your dreams are too common, you may accomplish them quickly and even
      with so much ease, but these will not attract the attention of so many
      people since it is a common thing which they see every day. If it is an
      uncommon dream, men will stand agape at its accomplishment.</p>
    <p class="article">The word ‘excellence’ means to stand out. If you must excel as a dreamer,
      you must stand out. To stand out, you must have a dream that stands out.
      You may not have excelled in school, but you can still excel and stand out
      in life simply by creating for yourself an uncommon dream!</p>
    <p class="article">Third-class students with uncommon dreams have an unequalled advantage
      over their mates - they have few or no competitors. Their other third
      class grade colleagues are not competing with them, they have accepted
      their fate. Their first class grade friends are not too excited about any
      dream, what will they need one for; they are already comfortable with the
      first class salary they get in their working place. This gives the third
      class graduate with an uncommon dream little competition and no rivalry.
      This makes it easy for you to have a smooth ride to the top.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>GO AHEAD AND DREAM</b></p>
    <p class="article">Carefully note here that if after trying all your best possible to get a
      big dream, all that keeps coming to your mind seems to be a small idea, do
      not neglect the small idea. It is better to be successful with something
      small than to be successful at doing nothing. Take a concrete step with
      it. It may be the first phase of a great dream.</p>
    <p class="article">Never say never to that small dream if that is all you have. That idea
      you consider as small, irrelevant and so unimportant may be the most
      important idea you will ever have in your life. Do not look down on it. It
      may be the reason why you are sent to the world. The idea may not sound
      great at the onset, but the truth is that there may be greatness at the
      end of it. If you neglect that small idea, you neglect your dream and when
      you neglect your dream, you miss your throne.</p>
