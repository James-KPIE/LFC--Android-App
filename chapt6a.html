    <h3 style="text-align: center;">LIVING A FIRST-CLASS LIFE WITH A THIRD-CLASS
      DEGREE</h3>
    <p class="article">This book is not about history, theory or theology. It is about bringing
      life to your dead dream of becoming a first-class personality in life,
      although you have a third class degree.</p>
    <p class="article">Unknown to you, while on campus, the main reason why you really desired
      to graduate with a first class was not just for your friends to respect
      you or for your family members to be happy for having a first class
      graduate in the family. Much more than these, hidden somewhere within your
      heart, is a secret aspiration to want to live a first class life in the
      future. That dream should not now be aborted simply because you did not
      make a first class in school.</p>
    <p class="article">Armed with this understanding, you will agree that graduating with a
      first class in school is only a means to an end and not the end in itself.
      The end in itself is living a first class life. The good news is that
      there are so many means to this end, and this book is about those means.</p>
    <p class="article">All third-class graduates aspire to live a first-class life after leaving
      school. That is why you are reading this book. No one wants to be left
      behind in life; everyone wants to belong, to feel among. However, it is
      also true that not all third-class students know how to go about it.</p>
    <p class="article">Going down the history lane, there are so many third-class graduates who
      have crossed over the boundary of third-class to become highly celebrated
      personalities in life. But there are numerous others who laboured all of
      their lives and at the end of the day died unnoticed and unsung. What is
      the difference?</p>
    <p class="article">Every third-class student in school who ended up becoming a first-class
      student in life had some things they did and some things they did not do.
      So also, every third-class student in school who got their dreams aborted
      in life also had some things they did and some things they refused to do.
      Only that the things the latter did are the ones the former neglected, and
      the things the latter neglected are the one the former embraced!</p>
    <p class="article">There are rules that govern every activity here on earth. There are
      things you must do and there are things you must not do to get your dreams
      fulfilled. The things you do and the things you do not do will determine
      if you will get your dream of living a first-class life accomplished or
      abolished, and how soon you will.</p>
    <p class="article">Discussed in this chapter are things you need to do in order to get your
      dreams accomplished.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>GOAL SETTING</b></p>
    <p class="article">Goal setting, simply defined, means, aiming at something. It means
      deciding what you want. No matter how passionately you desire to live a
      first-class life and how hard you pursue it, if you do not have a set
      goal, you will not achieve much.</p>
    <p class="article">You must aim at something. Everyone who aims at nothing will succeed at
      nothing. Undefined goals will cause you frustrations, loss of motivation
      and depression. If you do not set your goals, you won’t know what you want
      out of life and hence you will not be able to develop enough faith to do
      what you are supposed to do so as to move towards the target.</p>
    <p class="article">Goal setting matters a lot. Goal setting is to a dream what fuel is to an
      automobile. Before you start up with your dream, set your targets. Know
      what you want to achieve in a set time. If you have not set the goal, do
      not start yet. Only those who effectively set their goals succeed as
      dreamers.</p>
    <p class="article">Whatever decision you make when setting your goals will affect the future
      of your dream. So, take your time to do it. Do not do it in a hurry. Your
      set goals should be one that you can cope with because you may feel
      miserable if you set yourself impossible target and then fail to meet
      them.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>PLAN</b></p>
    <p class="article">It is a very natural phenomenon for man to want to act before planning
      than to plan before acting. Human beings find it easier to begin a thing
      than to sit down and plan for the things they want to do before starting
      out.</p>
    <p class="article">The temptation to jump into actions is always very strong. However, no
      matter how strong the urge is, please do not give in to acting before
      planning. Failure to plan, as commonly said, is planning to fail.</p>
    <p class="article">When Jesus said ‘take therefore no thought for the morrow, for the morrow
      shall take thought for the things of itself’ (Matt 6:34), unlike what most
      people think, He did not mean we are not to plan for the future, but that
      we should not fret, worry, or be anxiously concerned about the future.</p>
    <p class="article">He expects us to have our plans properly in place before acting. This is
      why He admonishes us to consider the wise planning of ants ahead of time
      (Prov. 6:6-8). If He wants us to learn about planning, He definitely wants
      us to plan.</p>
    <p class="article">Planning is the life-giving force of a dream. This has been confirmed in
      the lives of all successful dreamers. No dream has ever advanced in the
      absence of it.</p>
    <p class="article">Planning means thinking out ways of doing things and coming up with
      creative ideas of making them come to pass. You want to live a first class
      life, start thinking of ways to make this possible. The moment you start
      thinking about it, more options will be made available to you even before
      you start up.</p>
    <p class="article">This is one major advantage that planning has; it helps you make fewer
      impromptu and emergency decisions. Every major decision to be made that
      may affect the future of your dream adversely would have been made in
      advance ever before you will need to make them, at a time when you are not
      under any form of pressure and you can think right, so you will make well
      thought out and balanced decision.</p>
    <p class="article">Planning in advance will also help you tackle problems ahead of time
      before you encounter them in reality. It will give you enough time and
      ample opportunity to address the problems and propose the best of a number
      of solutions to them before you actually experience them.</p>
    <p class="article">Sit down and think. Make well-detailed plans. Stretch your brain beyond
      normal capacity and bring out something worthwhile. Refusing to make
      concrete plans is reaching the end of the dream before taking off.</p>
    <p class="article">Your big dream cannot survive on a small plan. Your wildest dream will
      need your wildest plan to be successful. If your dream is big, then you
      need a concrete plan that can carry the whole weight of your dream
      successfully. Only a good plan can take you to your goal.</p>
    <p class="article">Contrary to general opinion, proper planning does not make a man too
      rigid; neither does it make him behave like a robot. It does not make him
      over-anxious about tomorrow but rather it helps him get rid of most
      unnecessary concerns.</p>
    <p class="article">If you want to make it in the future, you must plan very well today.
      Without planning in advance, you will sink mid-way. The farthest you can
      get is just some few miles into your dream. You are definitely sure of
      getting into a problem before you go far. Things will get muddled up and
      you will not be able to advance any step further.</p>
    <p class="article">No architect starts to build without a plan. He first sits down, spends
      time with it, produces the blueprint before the building commences.
      Properly made plans can be likened to the blueprint of a house. With it,
      you have in your hands the direction you need to follow in order to get
      your dreams fulfilled. But without it, you lack the most important
      ingredient needed for a fulfilled dream.</p>
    <p class="article">Your plan is your guideline, your instruction manual. Your plans are the
      maps of your dream. They give your dream a sense of direction. They aid
      efficiency, enhance commitment and discourage laziness and
      procrastination.</p>
