	<h4 style="color:red" align="right">CHAPTER 5: Page 2</h4>
	<p class="article">Challenges of life are not strong enough to determine when you take your
      hands off your dream. Everybody knows this: No man makes history without
      having overcome difficulties. Hence the saying ‘every star has some
      scars’. So, do not be disturbed when they come. They are for your lifting.
      Before Joseph got to the palace, he passed through the pit and the prison.
      If you must get to the palace of fulfillment, you also need to go through
      the pit and the prison of challenges.</p>
    <p class="article">At such times, let your dream be your motivation, not the storm you are
      passing through. Adversities, most times, may be blessings in disguise.
      Your graduating with a third-class has its own benefits if you look at it
      closely. You only need to think well to discover this.</p>
    <p class="article">Every problem you face in the course of pursuing your dream is a catalyst
      that speeds up the chemical reaction. It launches you faster into your
      destiny. Every challenge you face has its own specific ways of being
      solved. Activate your mind; the solution is nowhere else but there.</p>
    <p class="article">Every problem has in it the seeds of its own solution. Find it out.
      Solutions to problems are pre-planned by God before the problem arises.
      Think it through. If you can’t think it through, you will sink in deeper.
      Stop all complaints and find the solution.</p>
    <p class="article">You are more than that challenge you are facing now. Do not let it trap
      you; there is a way out of it for you. The reason the situation has not
      changed is because you have not addressed it. Take time to analyse and
      address it critically. Do not just diagnose the problems; propose
      solutions and tackle them. Do not hope the problem will take care of
      itself. No, it won’t. You will have to. Challenges do not get solved by
      leaving them unattended to; that way, they grow stronger over time. Do
      something on time. A stitch in time saves nine.</p>
    <p class="article">There are three major ways by which you can tackle such problems.
      Firstly, you can try to avoid them and continue with your dream in their
      presence without minding their existence. You may not be able to overcome
      them, but you can control your reactions to them. Render them
      insignificant by your attitude to them. Do not give them the attention
      they demand. As long as they are not maximally distracting you and slowing
      down your progress, you can still make the necessary progress despite
      their presence.</p>
    <p class="article">Secondly, if it is so unavoidable that it stands tall in your path of
      progression and you just have to face it before you can take any
      significant step further, then sit down and find a lasting solution to it
      before you continue. Every problem has its own solution within it, if you
      can spend time with it long enough, you will discover a way out.</p>
    <p class="article">Thirdly, if after all you have tried, the problem still defies your
      series of solutions and persists, then you can try to control it. When you
      cannot completely eliminate the problem, reduce its effect on your
      progress, then shut your eyes to it. You cannot direct the wind on the
      sea, but you can adjust the sails of your boat. Play along with the
      problem, but let it be subjected to you. Be in charge. Determine the
      extent of its effect on your dream and try to minimize it so that it will
      not have much impact on your dream.</p>
    <p class="article">If you forget everything discussed so far, do not forget this: whatever
      difficulty you encounter in the journey from a third class personality to
      a first class life, there is a way out of it if you can think. Tackle the
      problem. If you only sit down and watch, it will soon become bigger than
      it is today, and will soon get out of hand.</p>
    <p class="article">Problems do not get solved by neglecting them, they become bigger. They
      only get solved by attending to them on time.</p>
    <p class="article">Make this a rule: Every small problem must be handled on time before it
      grows out of hand.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>PROCRASTINATION</b></p>
    <p class="article">Procrastination is the enemy’s number one strategy. It is an extremely
      harmful weapon in the camp of the enemy. After being applied consistently
      over time, it weakens a man’s will, destroys his interest, damages his
      zeal and finally ends up distorting his belief in himself. It hinders the
      fulfillment of brilliant dreams and limits his captive’s achievement.</p>
    <p class="article">Procrastination, simply put, means, to postpone to other times what can
      be done now. When a dreamer begins to procrastinate, his dream begins to
      die. Many third-class students have plausible ideas and good plans but
      have not carried out any of them because they constantly procrastinate.</p>
    <p class="article">Procrastination hinders one from taking any important step towards the
      fulfillment of his dream. “You can’t start now”, it tells him. “Why not
      start some other time? Must you start now? Why not later? Probably when
      you are a bit older, you know you are still young. Or when you are a bit
      richer, or when you have done your Post Graduate Diploma, or when you have
      done your Masters so as to make up for your third class, or when you
      finally travel out of this country, or when you are married and you have
      support from your wife, or when your father dies and you take over his
      assets/companies”.</p>
    <p class="article">If you listen to its voice, you are doomed. Graduates who have handed the
      direction of their lives into the hands of procrastination have ever lived
      to regret their action.</p>
    <p class="article">Live by this principle: Never wait to do tomorrow what you need to do
      today. There may always not be enough time for everything you want to do,
      but there definitely will always be enough time for what you need to do.</p>
    <p class="article">Start planning now on how to accomplish your dream, and do not just plan,
      start taking steps on what you have planned. A first-class graduate may
      procrastinate actions on his dreams, but you should not compare yourself
      with him. You do not want to be reminded again that he probably has better
      options available to him than you do and can allow some to slip away.
      Worst case, if he cannot pull his dream through again, he simply dusts his
      certificate and apply for a lucrative job somewhere. As a third-class
      graduate, you have fewer options and should not jeopardize any, since you
      cannot tell, for now, which will hit the jackpot and bring you fame.</p>
    <p class="article">Dreams are like birds; they have wings and can fly. If you postpone your
      actions on them, they will soon fly away to someone else who will make the
      best use of them.</p>
    <p class="article">While in school, when you were supposed to read your books, you did not
      read. You postponed your personal study till later times. You delayed the
      submission of your assignments, the preparation for your exams, and
      postponed every other thing you can procrastinate. This is what got you to
      where you are today - a third-class graduate, and in order to move forward
      from here, you have to learn how to respond faster to issues, especially
      when they are issues that have to do with your life and destiny. Make up
      your mind on what you want to do, and do it NOW.</p>
    <p class="article">Always keep a clear deadline in view. This will help you to achieve more
      than you plan to. If you always procrastinate, it will someday lead to
      laziness, and you will not be able to explain why! Laziness will mature
      into indecision, all in the name of flexibility. But indecision is not
      synonymous to being flexible. Before you know it, you will find yourself
      in the same shoes you are trying to run away from, ending up a third class
      personality in life.</p>
