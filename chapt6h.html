	<h4 style="color:red" align="right">CHAPTER 6: Page 8</h4>
	<p class="article">Likewise with ideas. Some ideas take a very short time, minimal energy
      and little or no funds before they are accomplished, but others take a
      relatively longer time. But know that the longer it takes your dream to be
      accomplished, the brighter its future and the greater is its impact on
      your generation. The longevity of your dream determines the greatness of
      the dream.</p>
    <p class="article">Most times, dreams that are achieved within a short period of time are
      always small dreams and dreams that take longer periods before coming to
      fruition are big dreams. In the biblical story of Joseph in the prison,
      the butler’s dream came to pass in three days but it is such a
      tiny dream compared to Joseph’s dream which took about thirteen years
      before it was fulfilled.</p>
    <p class="article">If your dream of living a first class life is taking longer than you
      think, relax: Do not get too impatient. You are going to be surprised at
      the end.</p>
    <p class="article">Whatever happens, do not quit. Never give up. Never! Never!! Never!!!
      Dreamers are not quitters. Even when there is a strong temptation to quit,
      resist it. Dreamers know that it is always too soon to quit. Dreamers are
      winners and winners do not quit, so, dreamers do not quit. Quitting is too
      expensive to be considered as an option at this stage. Are you discouraged
      today, remember this: it is too late to quit. Many are waiting to hear
      your success story. Do not let them down.</p>
    <p class="article">Get this straight from the start: the devil will not give up on your
      dream. He will try as much as possible to destroy it. But God also will
      not give up on your dream. He will endow you with every needed grace to
      put the devil to shame and accomplish your goals.</p>
    <p class="article">You therefore have no reason to give up on the dream before either of
      them gives up. If the devil won’t give up and God won’t give up either,
      then it is sheer foolishness for you to give up. Do not disappoint God. Do
      not let the devil rejoice over your failure. Do not let hell be glad over
      your aborted dream. Do not quit. Since God has not yet given up on you; so
      do not give up on yourself.</p>
    <p class="article">Never be deceived into thinking it will be easy to fulfill this dream.
      You will experience difficulties on the way but keep on persisting. You
      will undoubtedly face oppositions, resistance, doubts and criticisms
      before your dream is accomplished but do not stop. Do not expect to get
      there in a very easy way. Learn to face and overcome adversity.</p>
    <p class="article">Those who had their dreams fulfilled did not find it easier than you
      initially. Do not expect a smooth journey. Every worthwhile vision is
      always tough at the beginning. Everything will seem to work against you to
      grind your dream to a halt. Discouragement will set in to threaten your
      perseverance, however, never allow what you are going through to stop you
      from where you are going to.</p>
    <p class="article">The beauty of a postage stamp is in sticking to a particular letter for
      as long as it takes it to get to its final destination. So, likewise, the
      beauty of a dream is in persisting with it until it is finally fulfilled.
      A wise man once said, “Do not accept defeat until you have made the last
      attempt: Do not make the last attempt until you have succeeded”.</p>
    <p class="article">Humanly speaking, the natural spontaneous reaction of man during
      adversity is to give up. You will therefore need to resist it with all
      your power. Every time you face pressure, press on. Once you take off, do
      not back out. This is an indispensable fact of life. Do not move until you
      are sure of where you are going, but once you are sure of where you are
      going to, do not stop until you get there. God is there to see you
      through, even when it is not apparent to you.</p>
    
    <p class="article">Whatever the devil is doing to discourage you from pursuing your dream is
      enough evidence that there is greatness hidden somewhere in the dream and
      you are close to getting it. The devil will not show you the Red Sea
      unless you are about entering the Promised Land - the land of Canaan. He
      will not bring your way the wall of Jericho unless he knows better things
      await you in the nearest future - a land flowing with milk and honey.</p>
    <p class="article">Every opportunity for you to desert that dream is created by the devil
      for your failure. That dream, if actualized, will take you to places. No
      matter what comes against you, do not abandon it.</p>
    <p class="article">Do not let the enemy’s intention be your final decision. Retreat is
      preferable to surrender. Retreat and re-equip yourself, then re-fire and
      you will acquire your goal. No matter what the circumstances may be, do
      not retire but re-fire. Keep keeping on. Make sure you nurture that dream
      to reality. Let the dream grow. That singular idea will one day become
      your most prized possession.</p>
    <p class="article">There is only a little difference between ordinary dreamers and
      extraordinary dreamers. The difference is the five-letter word ‘EXTRA’.
      The ordinary dreamers do not put in the little extras that the
      extraordinary achievers put in. If you also will desire to be celebrated
      by life, despite your third class certificate, go the extra mile. Persist
      a little more and you will be right there on the fulfillment throne.</p>
    <p class="article">God is taking you somewhere; no matter what comes against you, keep
      following him with your dream. Keep persisting. The end will justify the
      means. Your consistent persistence will someday bring you to the realm of
      prominence.</p>
    <p class="article">If you have already forsaken that dream, it is not too late to clean up
      the dust gathering around it and revisit it one more time. You can still
      start up on it again. ‘The righteous man falleth seven times but he riseth
      again’. No matter how many times you have fallen. God has made enough
      provision for your rising; make the best use of it. Most successes come
      after several failures. You also can still succeed irrespective of how
      many failures you have recorded.</p>
    <p class="article">You may have indeed done all that is required of you but the idea is not
      yet yielding the desired result. All you need is to persevere the more. It
      takes the hammer of persistence to drive the nail of your dream through
      the hardwood of success. Although waiting is difficult, still wait. Only
      those who wait wins! Those who cannot wait lose. Many have wasted away
      because of their inability to wait. It is good to start taking steps on
      your actions, but it is better to finish. Do not die halfway; persist to
      the end.</p>
    <p class="article">Thomas Edison did not give up in his bid to find an effective filament
      for the incandescent lamp. He persevered until after thirteen months of
      repeated failure. He tried one more experiment and he saw the filament
      glow before him. That is the power of persistence. It turns failure to
      success. Dr. Jonas Salk worked unsuccessfully for three whole years before
      he could develop a vaccine for polio. Abraham Lincoln failed six attempts
      at the polls before he was eventually elected as the president to the
      United States. Even Albert Einstein, the respected investor, often
      considered to be the greatest genius of the twentieth century once said “I
      think and think for months, sometimes for years. Ninety nine times the
      conclusion is false, but the hundredth time, I am right”.</p>
    
      <p class="article">Dreamers are finishers. Do not die on the way. Finish the race. Most
        people give up before the race starts. Many others, when faced with
        difficulties, always tend towards the path of least resistance, which is
        spelt -QUIT. But do not join them. Do not be too much in a hurry to
        fulfill your dream. Whatever you get in a hurry you lose in a hurry. The
        dream may not get accomplished overnight, but it will someday. Decide
        that you won’t give in, look back or back out. Keep reminding yourself
        of all the reasons why you have to fulfill that dream. Then persist, and
        you will achieve.</p>
