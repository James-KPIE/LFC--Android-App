	<h4 style="color:red" align="right">CHAPTER 6: Page 6</h4>
	<p class="article">Since you graduated with a third class degree, the temptation will be to
      surround yourself with other third class students so you can really feel
      like a boss. However, third class notwithstanding, surround yourself with
      people who are smarter than you are. It pays you off at the end.</p>
    <p class="article">Move with like-minded people. Do not associate with people who do not
      know what they are doing, otherwise, you will be confused. If you follow
      people who are not going anywhere, you will end up nowhere. If you can get
      a first class student who believe in your dream enough to want to partner
      with you, all well and good. If not, do not just enlist anyone in your
      team just because he graduated with a third class. You are not forming a
      pity party. He must be smart enough to take your vision to a higher level.
      Such people are numerous around you; locate them.</p>
    <p class="article">People who will help you fulfill your dream may not be the first to
      approach you. They rarely do. Go find them. Ask God for the ability to
      help you know the people He has sent to work with you. God’s plan cannot
      be fulfilled by you alone. You will wear away and die before your time if
      you try to.</p>
    <p class="article">Ask God to link you up with faithful partners. If you do, God will bring
      you in contact with people you can work with, like-minded people who will
      believe in your dream so much that they are willing to do all in their
      power to make sure it lives.</p>
    <p class="article">They may be your neighbours, family members, co-workers, friends or
      probably people who you have never met before, who just heard of your
      dream and are interested in it. Once you discover such people, make your
      vision known to them and let them develop their vision within the frame of
      your vision.</p>
    <p class="article">Try to build them up and prayerfully give them a place in your dream. Get
      them fixed up before they are distracted by something else. Develop them
      into a strong and effective team which will serve as a foundation for your
      dream.</p>
    <p class="article">Learn more to impact them the more. Edify them spiritually: Nurture them
      in the word: and pray specifically for each one of them.
    <dl>
      <dd><i>Make use of the 5 ‘I’ theory to train them.</i></dd>
      <dd><i>Inform them of what you want from them</i></dd>
      <dd><i>Instruct them on how to go about it</i></dd>
      <dd><i>Influence them with your personal life and commitment</i></dd>
      <dd><i>Involve them right from the beginning to the end</i></dd>
      <dd><i>Inspire them each step of the way.</i></dd>
    </dl>
	</p>
    <p class="article">However, do not be selfish, be interested in them. In order to encourage
      and motivate them, crave for every opportunity to help them. Be concerned
      with their spiritual well-being as much as their physical well-being. Help
      them in times of difficulties by identifying with their problems.</p>
    <p class="article">Study their needs and solve the ones you can. Do not only be interested
      in what you can get from them but in also what you can give to them.
      Journey along with them on their rough roads in life. Love them without
      any human conditions.</p>
    <p class="article">Do not be partial. Treat everybody equally. If you are continually
      partial to one, especially at this early stage, the others may rebel - not
      only against you but also against your dream. If you are more interested
      in one more than others, do not show it openly.</p>
    
    <p class="article">Chastise when necessary, but do it in love. Rebuke when necessary but
      gently and honourably. Do not be too gentle with them so as not to pamper
      them and do not be too strict so as not to scare them away. Do everything
      moderately. Overlook minor mistakes. Bless the more and blame them less.</p>
    <p class="article">Praise and constantly reward every good deed to encourage the doer and
      motivate the others. Keep those who are committed to your dream jealously
      but persuade the reluctant ones.</p>
    <p class="article">Do not become a boss over them but a leader. Do not see them as your
      servant and yourself as their lord. See yourselves as partners in vision.
      Behave well before them in order to make a lasting impression on them.</p>
    <p class="article">Humble yourself before them, but do not demote or relegate your
      personality. Be humble enough to admit your humanity and mistakes but do
      not let them look down on your person or take advantage of it to turn you
      into an object of ridicule.</p>
    <p class="article">Recognize the individual worth and potentials of each of them. Take note
      of both the strong points and the weak points of each. No man on earth is
      perfect and none is without, at least, one area of weakness. Every man has
      his weak points. Emphasize their strong points and strengthen their weak
      points by providing, and if possible, sponsoring trainings that will make
      them improve on their ability and develop their personality.</p>
    <p class="article">Mend every broken relationship between your people on time before it
      degenerates into something worse. Address every issue that needs to be
      addressed immediately. Do not procrastinate. A stitch in time saves nine,
      they say.</p>
    <p class="article">Ask God to teach you how to go about it, then go ahead and do whatever He
      tells you to do. Do not allow the devil to snatch away those who believe
      in your vision and are supporting its course just because of some little
      misunderstanding. Getting like-minded people to replace them may not be as
      easy as you think. A bird at hand is worth two in the bush.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>TAKE RISKS</b></p>
    <p class="article">Most people living a first class life today are risk takers. They are
      daring, and that is why they excel. The confidence to take risks is an
      indispensable asset in the life of every dreamer. The willingness to
      venture into the unknown and chart new course is a common mark in their
      lives. Hence they are called ‘pathfinders’.</p>
    <p class="article">Most battles on earth are lost to fear: the fear of the unknown, the fear
      to take risks. You cannot live a first class life unless you take some
      measure of risks.</p>
    <p class="article">Do not hesitate to take the risks necessary for your dreams to soar.
      Dreamers are adventurous in nature. If you are not yet willing to take
      adventures, then you are not yet qualified to be called a dreamer.
      Dreamers are entrepreneurs. Decide in your heart to be one today. This
      decision, if made today, will create the future you desire tomorrow.</p>
    <p class="article">Each time you are faced with seemingly insurmountable odds, there is a
      way to turn the crisis into awesome victory, by taking risks.</p>
    <p class="article">Let your reaction to every problem be constructive. Rise up to face the
      challenging situation before you. Always look for what to do to progress
      in every situation. You will definitely find at least one thing to do. It
      may be risky, but, most times, it is about the only thing to do to make
      progress at that point.</p>
