	<h4 style="color:red" align="right">CHAPTER 6: Page 11</h4>
	<p class="article">Think before you speak. Meditate before you act. What you need for the
      next level is a revelation that comes only through dedicated time of
      meditation.</p>
    <p class="article">You must be able to sit down and think productively, bringing out
      creative ideas that will make those who came out with first-class in your
      school salute you if they hear of it. At this stage, if your head cannot
      think uncommonly, your life will sink unfailingly and no one will get to
      hear of you again.</p>
    <p class="article">You need to think well in order to take the right decisions. Only those
      who think well takes the right decision, and only those who takes the
      right decision are qualified to enjoy the best of life.</p>
    <p class="article">Most people do not really think productively; they only think too much
      but they really do not think too well. Their thought, though time
      consuming, is peripheral and not deep enough to bring out results. Some
      who think they are thinking are only worrying and fretting. These are not
      part of productive thinking. Learn to think in such a way that every
      session of your thinking will bring out something that will move your life
      forward. That is productive thinking!</p>
    <p class="article">Let everyone of your thought be connected to your purpose. Until this is
      done, your life does not make constant progress.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>(3) Your Association</b></p>
    <p class="article">God created us to be interdependent, not independent. No one is created
      to survive alone. Everybody needs somebody to rise. You need others as
      much as they need you. Therefore, learn to network together with others;
      it has great dividends.</p>
    <p class="article">You need something that someone else has, as much as others need
      something you posses. No man is an island. Everyone needs someone someday
      to get somewhere.</p>
    <p class="article">Locate the right association. When you locate the right association you
      will get the right information. The right information will help you go for
      the right skill. The right skill will motivate you to take the right move
      in the right way, and at the right time. All these put together will get
      you the right result.</p>
    <p class="article">The opposite is equally true. Wrong association gives you the wrong
      information, and you are led to take the wrong moves which will eventually
      lead your life in the wrong direction and you will end up with the wrong
      result. There is nothing as destructive as keeping a wrong association.</p>
