    <p class="article">It is really going to be pretty difficult to beam with smile everywhere
      you go, especially when you know that everyone around you know the grade
      you graduated with and will be wondering why you are smiling sheepishly
      around, but the joy of the Lord can illuminate your heart and brighten up
      your day so much so that you will radiate His glory and glow like the
      early morning sun every day, despite what the enemy thought he
      has deprived you off.</p>
    <p class="article">You may not have better grades, better connection and better
      opportunities, but with the peace of God, you sleep better. No hassle, no
      headache, no fear of the future. This joy has nothing to do with the fact
      that you have failed, but it is motivated by the fact that God can turn
      every failure to success in no time.</p>
    <p class="article">Learn to always smile in the face of adversity. Let the peace of God rule
      your heart. The Bible says this peace passes all understanding. If you
      allow it, it will take your mind off what you are going through and make
      you focus on where you are going to. It will create the joy of God in your
      heart. You will not be moved or troubled. You may not have the degree
      needed, but you know the one who can change every situation by one single
      decree.</p>
    <p class="article">It is this joy of the Lord which you radiate that others around you will
      notice. If you really have this joy in your life - the joy that comes from
      knowing the Lord - then you will be able to share it with others around
      you with a beautiful contagious smile, despite what you are going through.</p>
    <p class="article">This joy gives you strength, confidence, and a great hope for the future!
      It will make you stand out from others in your shoes.</p>
