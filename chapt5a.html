    <h3 style="text-align: center;">CHALLENGES TO LIVING A FIRST-CLASS LIFE</h3>
    <p class="article">Irrespective of what you graduate with, if you have a dream, a worthwhile
      one, you will definitely face some challenges. The devil will forcefully
      come after your dream to make sure that it does not see the light of day.
      He will fight you with all of his power; who knows, maybe this is the
      reason he fought you tooth and nail to make sure you do not graduate with
      a first-class degree, so as to discourage you from pursuing your dreams.
      But never give him a chance. Do not allow him to abort that great dream.</p>
    <p class="article">Aborted dreams are dreams, which are allowed to die before their day of
      accomplishment. They are plans that are not pursued, goals that are not
      worked on, desires that never saw the light of day, hopes that are dashed
      and aims that are deserted.</p>
    <p class="article">Aborted dreams are abandoned dreams. Their abandonment is orchestrated by
      the evil one. He is the chief abortionist, carrying out illegal abortions
      of dreams. He basically does three things to dreams - he steals, he kills
      or he destroys them. So says the Holy Book. He uses different weapons to
      achieve this. These weapons are discussed in this chapter.</p>
    <p class="article">When you launch out to fulfill your dream, you will surely encounter many
      circumstances, some of which may seem to task you beyond your own
      strength. Some of them might be worse than what you experienced when you
      graduated with an unfavourable degree. But be sure of this: The grace upon
      you to fulfill your dream is much more than the force with which the enemy
      seeks to destroy it. It is an undeniable fact that every dreamer will
      certainly be tempted with diverse challenges, but victory lies ahead of
      each temptation if such can persist.</p>
    <p class="article">If the enemy is after your dream, needless to say, it is because he knows
      there is a golden future at the end of the tunnel of the dream. The devil
      is not happy seeing your dreams fulfilled. He is more interested in seeing
      those dreams aborted. So he will place some hurdles along your path in
      life. He will not bring you to the wall of Jericho unless he is convinced
      you are going to a land flowing with milk and honey. He will not bring you
      to the Red Sea unless he knows you are going to the Promise Land. If he
      starts to run wild about your dream, it is simply because he has seen
      something unusually great about it.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>NO ONE CAN STOP YOUR DREAM</b></p>
    <p class="article">No one can stop you from achieving your dream. Only you can. Even the
      devil cannot destroy your dream unless you permit him. So, do not allow
      him whenever he comes. You have allowed him once, as a student on campus,
      and you know what this caused you. This is why you are reading this book.
      If you had graduated with a first-class or a better grade, you probably
      would have neglected this book the first time you saw the title. Do not
      allow him access to your dreams again. Keep your dream often within your
      heart, far away from his reach. You cannot afford the losses that an
      aborted dream will create again.</p>
    <p class="article">The devil does not necessarily hate your face, he hates your dream. He
      does not hate your name, your education, your qualification or your
      intelligence. What he hates is your purpose for desiring to be alive, and
      most times, this purpose is encapsulated in your dream, and so he will do
      everything possible to make that dream impossible. Do not give him room.
      Keep your dream alive by all means.</p>
    <p class="article">Whatever the devil tells you about your dream is the exact opposite of
      the truth. He does not know Godâ€™s detailed plan for either your life or
      your dream. He only tells lies. Do not listen to him. Do not give him
      attention. If you give him attention he will give you instructions. If you
      give him more attention, he will give you more directions.</p>
    <p class="article">He is like a barking dog. Every normal man ignores a barking dog; it is
      normal for a dog to bark. The moment it seizes to bark, it fails in its
      first responsibility as a dog. That is also the way to treat the devil.
      When he barks because of your dream, ignore him. It is the only way to
      make him go crazy, keep him silent and make him walk out of your way.</p>
    <p class="article">Some of the hurdles he will place on your path to make you discard that
      dream of living a first-class life are discussed below:</p>
    <p class="article"><b>PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES</b></p>
    <p class="article">Dreamers are successful problem solvers. Great dreams are often times
      disguised as impossible situations and unsolvable problems. The situation
      you find yourself in today, graduating with a third-class, may be the
      first impede you will have to overcome in order to advance your dream.</p>
    <p class="article">Diverse negative situations and circumstances will try to beat down your
      dreams. Setbacks will come to shrink your dream. But do not just throw
      away the idea because of the problems and challenges you encounter. There
      is no dream without a problem and there is no problem without at least a
      solution.</p>
    <p class="article">Never run away from the challenges of life. Neither should you be
      intimidated by them; meet them head on. You have all it takes to outlive
      every storm you come across in the pursuit of your dream; it is all wired
      up in your system. Simply step beyond your current limitations and just
      walk over the prevalent challenges.</p>
    <p class="article">It is time to stop looking for victories without battles; you will never
      find any. If you are expecting a problem-free dream, then you are pursuing
      a profit-free dream. A stressless dream is a strengthless dream. Every
      road, major or minor, has bus stops, and no two bus stops are exactly
      alike. Some are very comfortable, some are less comfortable, and there are
      others that are not comfortable at all. Such is life. There will always be
      bus stops of trials and temptations on the path to your dream.
      Some may be more comfortable than others and some others may just be
      unbearable. You however do not end your journey abruptly at a bus station
      simply because it either is more comfortable or less pleasurable; you
      press forward until you get to your destination.</p>
