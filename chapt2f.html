<h4 style="color:red" align="right">CHAPTER 2: Page 6</h4>
<p class="article">Forgiving others does not justify their actions, but it will free your
      heart from bitterness, enabling you to concentrate on more important
      things that will move your life forward.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>3) PAST PROSPECTS</b></p>
    <p class="article">So many are still tied to the opportunities they lost in the past. They
      live in a ‘If l had known’ world.</p>
    <p class="article">- If I had prepared better for the examination!</p>
    <p class="article">- If I had listened to my parent’s advice!</p>
    <p class="article">- If I had changed my friends on time!</p>
    <p class="article">- If I had attended the tutorials!</p>
    <p class="article">- If I had read my books more!</p>
    <p class="article">- If I had done the assignment!</p>
    <p class="article">- If I had not missed the test!</p>
    <p class="article">- If I had been closer to God!</p>
    <p class="article">- If I had known!</p>
    <p class="article">For how long will you continue to live your life on yesterday’s dream and
      possibilities? You need to shine your eyes to the realities of today and
      forget about what is gone behind. Too many fresh graduates are still
      locked in the illusion of what could have been in the past. They are so
      dissatisfied with life because they had some great expectation that did
      not materialize.</p>
    <p class="article">Please note that it is a lie from the pit of hell that the best
      opportunities you can have in life are the ones you have messed up in the
      past; never believe that. Better things still awaits you in the future.
      All you need to do is look into the future with great hopes, and you will
      see your desires materializing.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>4) PAST EVILS</b></p>
    <p class="article">It is possible to reason that you are where you are because of your past
      sins. You may think this is the reward of your past record of insincerity;</p>
    <p class="article">- You cheated in the examination hall,</p>
    <p class="article">- You lied on a friend,</p>
    <p class="article">- You hurt someone physically,</p>
    <p class="article">- You made a stupid remark to someone close to you,</p>
    <p class="article">- You stole someone’s belonging,</p>
    <p class="article">- You jilted your girlfriend,</p>
    <p class="article">- You were not faithful to God on campus,</p>
    <p class="article">- You joined the cult,</p>
    <p class="article">or because of a horrible sin you committed and you strongly believe that
      God will never forgive you because of the magnitude of the sin. It could
      be true, and it may not be!</p>
    <p class="article">Whether it is true or not, God is willing to forgive you any sin you
      committed in the past if only you are willing to confess it and forgive
      yourself first. It may not be very easy to forget them, but it is quite
      easier to forgive yourself and move forward with your life.</p>
    <p class="article">Do not let your life be tied down by anything that should have gone with
      the past. Open a clean state and start a fresh life. Let the scriptures be
      fulfilled in your life that says ‘old things are passed away; behold, all
      things are become new’</p>
    <p class="article">The pain of every failure will only last for as long as you keep
      refreshing your memory about it. The moment you decide to shut the door on
      the past and throw it behind you, it is no longer strong enough to afflict
      or haunt you.</p>
