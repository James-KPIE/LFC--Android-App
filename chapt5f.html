	<h4 style="color:red" align="right">CHAPTER 5: Page 6</h4>
	<p class="article">Believe in yourself. No one else may believe in you, because of your past
      record, but you must have a very strong faith in your own ability, because
      it is what you believe that will sooner or later become. Your fate in life
      is your faith in yourself. Great pastors, president of nations, corporate
      CEOs, successful athletes, all got there because they believed in
      themselves when no one else did, and they did what they could before
      anyone else believe they could.</p>
    <p class="article">You may lose everything, but do not lose faith in yourself. So many
      third-class students have done seemingly impossible things. You too can.
      If others can succeed with their dreams, you also can. Do not doubt your
      strength; believe in His ability, that God is able to make you capable.</p>
    <p class="article">What you think about yourself matters more than what others think of you.
      Think of yourself based on what God says you are in His word. Do not be
      over-influenced by what other people think of you or say about you. Do not
      allow what they say about you affect your personal opinion of yourself.</p>
    <p class="article">What men say about you is what they think about you. Their opinion about
      you is often based on wrong motives and wrong assessment. What you think
      about yourself is what you say about yourself and it is what you say about
      yourself that counts, because it is what you will become at last. You know
      what you are - a dreamer, a winner, a ruler, and God see you as such - a
      dreamer, a winner and a ruler.</p>
    <p class="article">Their conclusion about your life does not really matter as much as what
      you believe about yourself. Therefore, only live by what God says and not
      what any man says about you. It is what The Word says that counts, not
      what the world says. You are more encouraged when you see yourself the way
      God sees you and believe you can be what the Bible says you can than when
      you admit men’s impression about you.</p>
    <p class="article">Search through your mind today and flash out every thought that belittles
      you. What you think about yourself is God conclusion about your matter.
      Your faith is determined by your thought.</p>
    <p class="article">Whatever you lack, He has. Whatever you need is in His bank. He knows how
      to make extra-ordinary achievers from ordinary men. If you will trust Him,
      His super ability will come upon your natural ability and will make you of
      supernatural ability. Forget about your weaknesses. When man reaches his
      inability, God’s ability starts.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>DISCORDS</b></p>
    <p class="article">If the devil fails in all his methods to make the dreamer forsake his
      dreams, he attacks the people around him who believe in his vision and who
      are assisting him to fulfill the vision. He sows discord and hatred in
      their midst, thereby causing confusions which may lead to separation. The
      devil probably learnt the use of confusion in aborting dreams when, at the
      tower of Babel, God confused the language of the people in order to stop
      the greatest project of their time – building a tower that reaches to
      heavens.</p>
    <p class="article">Remember that, whether you admit it or not, most of those who are
      supporting your dream today and working together with you for its
      fulfillment have their impression about you, that being a third-class
      student, there is little or nothing they can expect from you, especially
      at this early stage of your dream.</p>
    <p class="article">It may even be that the reason some of them are still with you is because
      they have no other alternative jobs and not necessarily because they love
      you and believe in your dream that much. The moment they get something
      that offer a better package than what you offer them, they will be too
      willing to part ways with you, without even minding how you feel about it;
      you are just a third class graduate!</p>
    <p class="article">This should in no way surprise you. Some of them accord you the workplace
      respect not because they esteem and admire you as a boss with good IQ and
      quality character. They feel you are only opportune to have richer
      parents, or better connections than them. They actually think that if they
      have the same opportunity that life has offered you, they will perform far
      better than you have. They think they are smarter and more brilliant than
      you, though they may not tell you this.</p>
    <p class="article">Most of these ones will be on the lookout for any flimsy excuse, tenable
      or not, to have a disagreement with you when they are ready to leave. They
      want it to look as though you are the bad guy. You may not have any
      problem with it, but they actually do not keep their opinion to
      themselves. They try to poison the minds of your most faithful
      partners/coworkers so as to gain more pity for themselves when they are
      ready to leave. This is where the real issue is.</p>
    <p class="article">The ability to handle well every crisis that rises on the path of
      fulfillment of your dream will help to guard against the scattering of
      your partners, and consequently, the destruction of your tender dream.</p>
    <p class="article">When the devil could not get Paul and Barnabas to forsake their dream of
      spreading the gospel among the Gentiles, he brought disagreement and
      disunity between them, over an insignificant issue. This led to the
      separation of the joint vision of the first partners in the ministry.</p>
    <p class="article">The devil tried on a number of occasions to destroy the dream the
      Israelites had of getting to the Promised Land by causing discord among
      them. So many times, he caused them to murmur and revolt against God,
      against the leadership; and against each other. Each time this happened,
      it caused them a great deal of setback.</p>
    <p class="article">Every time you sense a spirit of disagreement, confusion, rebellion,
      disunity and hatred among your coworkers, instantly go to God and ask him
      for wisdom to tackle it and put things back into proper shape before it is
      too late. Do not do it with your wisdom or experience. It is risky. Unless
      you have God’s wisdom, you will mishandle the crisis and may fuel the
      problem the more.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>ENSLAVEMENT BY THE PAST</b></p>
    <p class="article">In life, it does not matter whether you have failed or succeeded in the
      past, what matters is the next step you take. This will determine whether
      your success or your failure is going to be continuous.</p>
    <p class="article">Earlier on, we discussed about forgetting your past. This is because it
      is very common with the human nature to get easily discouraged by past
      failures and easily carried away by past achievements, thereby causing
      them to neglect the remaining part of their dream, or making them to
      relent in their efforts unconsciously and slowing down the original pace
      with which they started.</p>
    <p class="article">The past is a great obstacle to a greater tomorrow. So, do not make the
      mistake of letting your yesterday take too much of your today. Slaves who
      are in the captivity of the past cannot become masters of tomorrow.
      Whoever lives in the past, tarnishes the present and sacrifices the
      future.</p>
    <p class="article">Enslavement by the past may come in two ways:</p>
    <p class="article">(1) Enslavement by Past Failures</p>
    <p class="article">(2) Enslavement by Past Successes</p>
