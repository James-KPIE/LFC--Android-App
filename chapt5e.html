	<p class="article">Dream killers discouraged David from going to fight Goliath but he
      shunned them. They told Bartholomew the blind man to keep quiet when he
      called on Jesus to have mercy on him; he did not listen to them. The woman
      with the issue of blood knew them when she saw them and she avoided them.
      If you also want to live a first class life with your third class result,
      you will need to avoid dream killers.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>DISTRACTIONS</b></p>
    <p class="article">One major problem of most third-class graduate is that many of them
      cannot say no to potential diversions.</p>
    <p class="article">This was actually what mainly contributed to their failure as a student
      in school, the inability to say no to distractions. They had
      so many things competing for their time; social functions, sports,
      parties, fellowship meetings, tribal meetings, students’ businesses,
      politics, and the likes, such that they were constantly distracted from
      their academics without knowing it.</p>
    <p class="article">Albert Einstein once said ‘doing the same thing the same way over and
      over again and expecting a different result is the definition of
      insanity’. If you must make a first class in life, then you must desist
      from this action that made you graduate with a third class from school.</p>
    <p class="article">Lack of full concentration is the reason why many people are losing out
      today. It is commonplace for one to have another dream while working on
      the first. The temptation to start on the new dream is always so great,
      especially if the first is proving to be difficult to get through with.
      However, most times, if embarked on, this new dream becomes a source of
      distraction from the first dream that is almost accomplished but for some
      steps.</p>
    <p class="article">Vision is better pursued when there are no distractions. Once there is
      another vision, there comes a division, and if care is not taken, the
      first vision can no longer enjoy the undivided attention it enjoyed
      before, slowing down the pace at which it is achieved.</p>
    <p class="article">Do not let the devil distract your attention by giving you a new vision,
      an entirely different vision from your original dream. So many people have
      failed in life because they cannot concentrate fully on one major idea per
      time, especially at this starting stage.</p>
    <p class="article">Whatever new vision you have must be in line with your first dream.
      Joseph had a dream. He had a second one, and he had a third. But all his
      dreams were focused on just one thing – to lead his people. He never
      considered a different vision. At the end of the day, he got what he
      wanted.</p>
    <p class="article">You too do not need another dream. If the devil tries to sell one to you,
      do not buy. If he succeeds in diverting you away from your first vision,
      he has succeeded in destroying your vision with your permission. Do not
      cooperate with the devil to destroy your dream.</p>
    <p class="article">Take note of this: Every time the devil gives you a new vision when you
      have not fully accomplished the first, it is for a purpose - to make you
      neglect the first. So every time you receive a new dream when you are
      still working on one presently, whether it is from God or from the devil,
      the best thing to do is to write it down, pray and plan towards it and do
      not really commit yourself fully to it until you have accomplished the one
      you have at hand. If it is really from God, it will stand the test of
      time.</p>
    <p class="article">For the purpose of creating a balance, wisdom demands that if what you
      are working on presently is a big dream which will take a long time to be
      accomplished, and a smaller dream which will take a relatively shorter
      period of time crosses your part, you can still cope with the two since
      you will do away with the smaller one in a very short time after its
      accomplishment. But this cannot be done with two major ideas. If the new
      dream is not willing to wait, one will have to die for the other to live.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>LOW SELF ESTEEM</b></p>
    <p class="article">Many third-class graduates, as a result of their past academic
      experience, have such a low self esteem of themselves. They do not believe
      they can accomplish anything meaningful again, no matter how small. Some
      others believe they have the ability to accomplish the smaller dreams but
      not the bigger ones.</p>
    <p class="article">They do not believe in themselves and their ability and so are afraid of
      acting on their dreams. The ghost of their inability to pass ordinary
      final year examination in school haunts them about so much so that it
      scares them away from taking every necessary step to achieve their dreams.
      They tend to believe more strongly in the lies concerning them that they
      are weak vessels and so cannot accomplish great things.</p>
    <p class="article">This is a serious matter, especially among third-class graduates. Many of
      them are too busy focusing on their inabilities and their areas of
      weaknesses that they fail to see their abilities and their strengths. More
      of their visions are destroyed through the thought of incapability than
      any other weapon. This is a major stumbling block to third class
      graduates. The world tries to limit them by making them think they are not
      capable of successfully achieving any goals again. It makes them think
      they are not qualified enough to undertake such great tasks.</p>
    <p class="article">This occurred in the account of almost all the great men recorded in the
      Bible. Moses complained of not being eloquent enough, but he ended up
      being the greatest leader in his generation. King Saul ran away on the day
      of his coronation. King Solomon complained of being “but a child who does
      not know how to go out or come in”. Gideon needed so many confirmations
      from heaven to convince God He is making the right choice. All of them
      felt incapable at first, but were greatly used at the end.</p>
    <p class="article">Do not be discouraged by your past. Do not limit your capability by your
      disposition or who you are at the moment. Do not look down on yourself
      because of your qualification. The apostles never went to school but they
      all fulfilled their ministry. You too will if you trust Him.</p>
    <p class="article">Successful achievement of your dream remains impossible until you
      absolutely believe in yourself. You can only become the dream you believe
      you can achieve. When you have a low estimation of yourself, you are
      giving yourself a passport of failure and a visa of un-fulfilled dream.</p>
    <p class="article">Strive to disconnect yourself mentally and emotionally from the low self
      esteem socket. If you don’t, it will unconsciously affect every other area
      of your life, whether you intended it to be or not.</p>
    <p class="article">You need a strong and good self image. This is not to say you should look
      on yourself as a perfect superhuman entity that needs no amendments or
      improvements. But do not look down on yourself because of your weaknesses.</p>
    <p class="article">Only a foolish man builds on his weaknesses. Forget about all your
      inability, at least for now. Do not look down on yourself or your dream.
      You can do it. Place the right value on yourself. Do not give yourself the
      license to stay in the cesspit of impossibility. Get rid of that
      grasshopper mentality. Your result in school does not determine your
      result in life; that you were not able before now does not mean you will
      never be able again. You are well able.</p>
    <p class="article">If you appreciate yourself, you will command appreciation from others. If
      you have enough self confidence in yourself, it will build up other
      people’s confidence in you. It will show through your carriage, your
      actions and your words, and these will give you additional mark and
      positive reception everywhere you find yourself.</p>
