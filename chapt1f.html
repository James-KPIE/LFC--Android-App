	<h4 style="color:red" align="right">CHAPTER 1: Page 6</h4>
	<p class="article">been cut shot. Your friends might be too ashamed to still identify with
      you; but God is not disappointed in you.</p>
    <p class="article">God looks at things in a different light than man does. This is because
      man is easily impressed by the wrong things in life,
      neglecting the things that matters.</p>
    <p class="article">God does not view people the way others see them. He sees them in a
      different perspective. Man saw Moses as a murderer but God saw in him a
      deliverer. Jacob was called a supplanter but God saw a prince. Abraham was
      termed barren but God saw the father of many nations. Rahab was a
      good-for-nothing prostitute but God saw in her the great grandmother of
      the Saviour. Whatever they have said about you is their opinion. God’s
      opinion still stands.</p>
    <p class="article">Men may write you off, but God will not: It is not in His nature: Adam
      and Eve failed God’s maiden exam on obedience in the Garden of Eden and
      could have easily been written off by God. However, the whole Bible is a
      record of God’s plan and effort to reverse that failure; that is God for
      you. He looks beyond the present into the future in order to correct the
      mistakes of the past. Be sure that He is already working out something in
      your favour too.</p>
    <p class="article">Nothing happens by chance to us; God has a pre-knowledge of all that we
      will ever go through. He may not be responsible for them though; the
      unpalatable circumstance may be as a result of our negligence, nonchalance
      or carefree attitude, but God can still work around those circumstances so
      that His purpose will be achieved through them.</p>
    <p class="article">It really does not matter what your grade is to God, first class or third
      class. He loves you anyway. He does not use your degree in school to
      determine His decree in your life. He is still interested in you and what
      you become, irrespective of who is not! He is interested in everything
      that concerns you. You are the apple of His eye! He said your face is even
      tattooed on the palms of His hand! So, He can neither neglect you nor
      forget about you.</p>
    <p class="article">Only God can eternally write off a man as a failure. But He has not
      written you off yet. So, why believe what a mortal man like you has said
      about you. Whatever any man says is his opinion, and everyone has a right
      to his own opinion. Let it not over-bother you.</p>
    <p class="article">No one knows your destiny perfectly like God. Therefore let no one fit
      you into another man’s mould. No one was there when God was commissioning
      you into the world. So, no one has a say over your life. Only His word
      will stand in your life, if you are willing to permit it.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>BE FRIENDLY</b></p>
    <p class="article">You do not have to be moody everywhere you go. Many people just focus on
      the problems they are passing through, that they miss the opportunity to
      meet the wonderful people and great benefits they see everywhere they go
      which God has prepared to lift them up from their present position to the
      next level.</p>
    <p class="article">Being unfriendly, they miss their saviour; they miss the angel God sent
      to them to help them from their predicament. Make friends daily. Do not be
      ashamed to meet people because of your academic qualifications. It is not
      in the qualification, it is in what you have to offer.</p>
    <p class="article">Grab every opportunity to build fresh relationships, especially with
      those who desires to live a first class life like yourself and not just
      with anybody.</p>
