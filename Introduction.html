						<h3 class="heading-section">Introduction</h3>
						<p style="text-align: justify;">Everyone who moves around with a third class
      certificate has the potentials to live a first-class life. This is what
      this book is all about, learning to live a first class life with a third
      class certificate. I am not too bothered that you have failed in school.
      My concern is how you can bounce back and become someone to reckon with in
      life, even with your third-class certificate.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Truly you have failed, but this is not the
      worst of your failure. You have failed several times before now, and have
      successfully bounced back effortlessly. You may not remember this, but I
      do vividly.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The very first time you tried walking as a
      baby, you fell flat on your face, not once, not twice, but you rose up
      again, and tried it a few more times, until you learnt the act perfectly.
      Today, you walk about without giving it a thought, as though you had never
      failed in walking before.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The very first time you tried to swim, you
      almost drowned; thanks to God for the lifesavers around you then, you
      would have lost your life untimely and would have been buried and long
      forgotten. Today, you swim as though it is a natural thing to do. You can
      even dare a swimming competition, just because you are sure of how good
      you are at it, without remembering you had failed in it before.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The very first time you learnt to drive,
      with a big bold red color letter ‘L’ on a white cardboard pasted both in
      front and at the back of your car, you mistakenly matched the brake
      instead of the clutch, took the turtle for the brake, and almost hit the
      wall, but for your driving-lesson tutor beside you. You wondered then if
      you would ever really know how to drive a car because of the constant
      mistakes you were making during the driving lessons. All those are stories
      now! You can drive fifty kilometers without any difficulty. You are now an
      expert at driving, a skill you once taught you would never know.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">These are just a few of your numerous
      records of failures in times past. However, you have been able to cross
      over from the boundary of failure to the side of success in the same
      ventures that sometimes ago seemed you really would not be able to find a
      way around. The same factors that worked for you then, can still work for
      you now, irrespective of who, or what is against you, third-class degree
      notwithstanding!</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Living A First-Class Life With A Third-Class
      Degree Sam. O. Salau</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is not very unusual to fail in your first
      attempt at something. Since this is your first attempt at getting an
      academic degree, your failure is not something to kill yourself over. Do
      not worry about this failure. You have not yet committed an unpardonable
      sin by failing. You have bounced back at other times you failed before
      now. So, I am very certain that you will bounce back this time too, if you
      can only do the right thing.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This book, <b>LIVING A FIRST-CLASS LIFE
        WITH A THIRD-CLASS RESULT</b>, is not to blame you of your failure, but
      to let you know that you can bounce back again, and teach you the ‘how
      to’, until you become the talk-of-the-town.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is possible! You can still live a
      first-class life, even with your third-class result, if you are willing to
      do what I am about to show you. Others have done it before, and you also
      can.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Happy reading, <br>
      <b>Sam. O. Salau</b><br>
