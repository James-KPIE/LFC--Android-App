	<h4 style="color:red" align="right">CHAPTER 1: Page 3</h4>
	<p class="article">The truth is that you are the only one who thinks you have offered your
      best; your lecturers think otherwise, the examiners think otherwise, the
      invigilators think otherwise, the school authority thinks otherwise.</p>
    <p class="article">Your opinion, no matter how hard you hold on to it, does not count in the
      face of so many expert criticisms. So, they can only be right, and you can
      only be wrong; you deserve what you got.</p>
    <p class="article">Admit your failure. Trying to pretend you got better grades will not help
      you. It is self deception of the highest order. Tell yourself that you
      have failed from the higher institution because you graduated with a
      third-class degree. Say it to yourself a thousand and one times until it
      sinks into your subconscious. This will help you to face the reality and
      do what you really need to do.</p>
    <p class="article">It will not make too much sense wasting your precious energy trying to
      cover up the failure. It will not work. Face the facts; admit your
      failure. Do not pretend to be what you are not. Putting on a Superman’s
      garment does not enable you to fly; it only gives you an overblown
      assessment of yourself.</p>
    <p class="article">A wolf in a sheep’s clothing is still a wolf. A third-class graduate
      pretending to be a first-class graduate is still a third-class graduate,
      no matter how hard he pretends. Do not claim to be what you are not; you
      have failed from school, and there is no use denying the fact. It is even
      already too late to change the situation; you are already a third-class
      graduate. So the earlier you get use to it, the better for you.</p>
    <p class="article">This is not to say you need to start broadcasting round the whole school
      or your neighbourhood that you have failed again; there is not much wisdom
      in this. Just be yourself and let things happen whichever way life has
      planned it. Do not try to hide the fact or overprotect it. Let nature take
      its natural course.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>DO NOT EXPECT TO BE CELEBRATED</b></p>
    <p class="article">Since most people around you do not believe you deserve much more than
      you got, do not expect them to sympathize with you as much as you desire.
      They will not celebrate your failure simply because you think you tried
      your best. This may, or rather, this will, in most cases, never happen.
      Let not your expectation be too high, people do not celebrate failures, no
      matter how close you are to them, and irrespective of the excuse you have
      for the failure!</p>
    <p class="article">No one will cheer you up for graduating with a third-class grade. If you
      expect to be cheered, you are expecting too much, and your expectation
      will certainly be cut short. This is just natural. People do not cheer up
      those who fail. Only the man who wins gets the accolade.</p>
    <p class="article">None will celebrate you for failing:</p>
    <p class="article">- Not your parents, all the money they spent on you is now wasted; at
      least, that is how it looks to them.</p>
    <p class="article">- Not your lecturers, you made them look as though they do not know how
      to teach. You would have been their pride if you have shown to the world
      that their student is a genius.</p>
    <p class="article">- Not your classmates who expected you to be smarter than you proved to
      be. If anybody should fail, it should not be you. They knew how they went
      about it and expect that you also should know how to go about it if you
      know your ability is not adequate.</p>
    <p class="article">- Also, not your younger ones, you did not set a good example for them to
      follow, and they cannot boast of you in the midst of their own friends.</p>
    <p class="article">- In fact, not your friends, they are highly disappointed in you. They
      expected far much more.</p>
    <p class="article">- Definitely not your senior ones who will never understand why you have
      to go for a third-class grade when there are better options, especially if
      you are the first in the family to get that low.</p>
