	<h4 style="color:red" align="right">CHAPTER 6: Page 4</h4>
	
	<p class="article">There is only one way to go forward, by taking conscious steps forward.
      Do not stay put; go forward. You can reach that goal if you pursue it.
      Dreamers are doers. Do it. Do the right thing at the right time.</p>
    <p class="article">Nothing will ever be achieved if all the possible objections must first
      be conquered before you act. If you have to wait until all the traffic
      lights on the road to where you are going turns green before leaving the
      house, you will never leave the house. Do not wait until all the problems
      are solved before you take a step. Your dream will be terminated in
      frustration and disappointment if you do.</p>
    <p class="article">If your problem is that you feel you do not have much to offer; then you
      do not have any problem. Almost everyone feels the same way at the
      commencement of the development of a new dream, even the so called
      geniuses. Just follow this simple rule: Never decide to do nothing just
      because you can do little. Start where you are with what you have, no
      matter how small.</p>
    <p class="article">Most great accomplishments are simply made up of small steps taken one
      after another. You may not necessarily start in a big way, but you can
      start somewhere and with something too. Whatever thing you have; just
      start with it. Only very few of the things that start big in life end up
      big; most of them end up small. Most big things in life always start
      small. Start it anyhow with what you have; you have waited long enough.</p>
    <p class="article">If your problem is money, start with the little in your hand. Do not
      throw away the idea because you are not rich. So many successful men in
      the world today had little or no wealth to start-up with from the scratch.</p>
    <p class="article">If you think your problem is lack of education, so many of the great
      inventors the world had ever boasted of had no education. The few ones who
      had little education were dropouts in school. Whatever level of education
      you have now is enough to start with.</p>
    <p class="article">Start today. The little you have is exactly the much you need for a
      start. What you do not have today you do not need today. All you have to
      start up is all you need; all you need to start up is all you have. If you
      need much more as time goes on God will provide as the need arises.</p>
    <p class="article">Take one small step at a time continuously. Dreams are useless when not
      acted upon. Action makes them real. Make the first move. You will never
      know how far you can get, or what you can do if you do not make the first
      move.</p>
    <p class="article">If you do not make the move, you won’t hit the mark. Only those who make
      the move hits the mark, only those who hits the mark makes the name, only
      those who makes the name gets the fame, only those who gets the fame makes
      the dough, only those who makes the dough ends up living a first class
      life. Therefore unless you make the first move, and follow it up with the
      necessary subsequent moves, you won’t live a first class life.</p>
    <p class="article">Every great step is preceded by small actions and every great
      accomplishment is heralded by little beginnings. Be willing to take the
      first step. If you do, you will find a great deal of satisfaction in it so
      much so that the next steps ahead will be full of pleasures rather than
      duress. Do not wait for success; it is already waiting to welcome you.
      Take the step to go meet it.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>CONCENTRATE ON YOUR DREAM</b></p>
    <p class="article">If you have discovered your dream, give your total life to the pursuance
      of it. Be determined to make something beautiful out of the dream.</p>
    
    <p class="article">Concentrate so much on it till it dominates your entire being. Let it
      become a drive that controls every bit of your actions. Set it in your
      imagination. Always talk about it. Meditate so much upon it so it can
      become so real to you. Let it fill your thoughts, affect your words, and
      motivate your actions.</p>
    <p class="article">Your dream demands tireless inputs. Give it continually. Give time and
      attention to it. Give it all it takes. Let nothing distract you. Let it
      obsess you. Until it becomes an obsession, you have not committed your
      whole being to it. Sow your whole life into it, let your spirit, soul and
      body be totally committed to it. Let your will, emotions and mind be sold
      out to it.</p>
    <p class="article">When your will takes the lead, every other thing follows because your
      will paves the way. A popular adage says, “Where there is a will, there is
      a way”. So create the will power. Great achievements come through great
      desires. Great desires are built through great drives. Great drives are
      developed through great concentration on great dreams. You already have a
      great dream - the desire to live a first class life with a third class
      result - all you need now is a great concentration on that dream.</p>
    <p class="article">Give your dream all it takes to grow - your time, your energy, your
      finance and your all. Do not starve the dream of anything it desires,
      especially things needed for its growth.</p>
    <p class="article">If it takes burning the midnight candle to pursue the dream, please do;
      if you had burnt it on campus you won’t be where you are today.</p>
    <p class="article">If it requires cutting down on your relaxation period, do not resist; too
      much time spent on relaxation in school is one reason why you are being
      referred to as a third class graduate today.</p>
    <p class="article">If it entails giving it far more than you have planned to, do not draw
      back; if you had given it all that is needed at your first trial in school
      may be you would have graduated with a first class and would not need to
      go through this hassle.</p>
    <p class="article">Pursue your goal whatever it costs. Avoid all distractions. Avoid a
      broken focus: only those who gaze constantly at where they are going gets
      to where they intend. Give all you have today for the success of your
      dream, it will give you all you need to be a success tomorrow. Concentrate
      all your energy on a limited set of targets and you will be surprised at
      the meaningful progress you will make within a short period of time.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>DEVELOP YOURSELF</b></p>
    <p class="article">If you want to be successful in this your quest of living a first class
      life with a third class certificate, you will have to move with others who
      have been successful before you.</p>
    <p class="article">Provide for yourself godly role models. Associate yourself with those who
      are willing to bring out the best out of you. Mingle yourself with people
      who have gone ahead of you in the same direction you desire; people who
      will encourage you towards reaching your goals.</p>
    <p class="article">If there is someone who knows something that you should know, something
      that will help fulfill your dream, go to him. Listen to him, learn from
      him and observe what he does. Has there been anyone who had done something
      close or related to your dream? Get in contact with him and learn all you
      can from him.</p>
    <p class="article">Search out at least one dreamer who has paid the price to make his dreams
      come to pass and become his student. If he is dead, get his writings and
      all available information about him that you can lay your hands on. Use
      his ideas as a bedrock on which you will develop yours.</p>
