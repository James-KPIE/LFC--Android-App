    <p class="article">It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the
      strong man stumbled or where the doer of deeds could have done them
      better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose
      face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives
      valiantly; who errs, and comes short again and again, because there is no
      effort without error and shortcoming; who does actually try to do the
      deed; who knows the great enthusiasm, the great devotion, and spends
      himself in a worthy cause; who, at the worst, if he fails, at least fails
      while daring greatly. <br>- <b>President Theodore Roosevelt</b></p>
    <p class="article">‘You gain strength, courage, and confidence by every experience in which
      you really stop to look fear in the face. You must do the thing which you
      think you cannot.’ <br>-<b> Eleanor Roosevelt</b></p>
    <p class="article">‘When a resolute young fellow steps up to the great bully, the world, and
      takes him boldly by the beard, he is often surprised to find it comes off
      in his hand, and that it was only tied on to scare away the timid
      adventurers.’ <br>-<b> Ralph Waldo Emerson</b></p>
    <p class="article">One half of knowing what you want is knowing what you must give up before
      you get it. <br>-<b>Sidney Howard</b>-</p>
    <p class="article">‘One of the greatest problem of our time is that many are schooled but
      few are educated’ <br>- <b>Thomas More</b></p>
    <p class="article">Success is often not a matter of talent but a matter of tenacity. <br>-<b>Nathaniel
        H. Bronner Jr.</b></p>
    <p class="article">No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.<br>-<b> ELEANOR
        ROSEVALT.</b></p>
