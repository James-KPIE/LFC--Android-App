	<h4 style="color:red" align="right">CHAPTER 2: Page 5</h4>
	<p class="article">Everybody makes mistakes; Presidents, First Ladies, Governors, Pastors,
      Politicians, Senators, Doctors, Engineers, Lawyers, Judges, CEO’s, even
      the best of the best. “Nobody is above mistakes”, so goes the saying.</p>
    <p class="article">Everyone has, at one time or the other, took decisions which they later
      regretted in life; but that was not the end of their career. They moved
      beyond the mistake to make impact in their generations. You also can move
      beyond this point of your life to the point where you will fulfill destiny
      if you will put the past behind you.</p>
    <p class="article">The great scientist, Thomas Edison failed the same experiment one
      thousand times. What a record! If such happened in this generation, it
      would have a whole page dedicated to it in the latest edition of The
      Guinness Book of Records as the highest number of failure recorded in a
      single experiment by an individual. Dale Carnegie, a celebrated author and
      public speaker confessed he had a folder on his table with the title ‘FTD’
      - It stands for ‘Foolish Things I Have Done.’ In it he documented his
      stupid actions.</p>
    <p class="article">Everybody makes mistakes. Everyone does stupid and foolish things once in
      a while. So everyone must be willing to forgive himself, including you!
      Your ability to move forward in life will be dependent on how much you are
      willing to bear the consequences of your past mistakes, forgive yourself
      of the stupid decisions, shut your eyes on the past, make necessary
      corrections, and move forward with life.</p>
    <p class="article">Constantly and persistently looking back in life always ensures your
      going in the same direction. Lock the door on your past mistakes, throw
      the key away, and forget where you have thrown it.</p>
    <p class="article">Wipe away your tears; no evil has befallen you. Let no one send any
      condolence message to you. Quit the grief. Tear off the sackcloth. Stop
      causing yourself needless pains. Wear a bright smile. Look ahead into the
      future with great hope. Your future is bright, and I can testify of it.</p>
    <p class="article">Begin to live a life free of guilt and self-condemnation. Do not be
      reluctant to expect the best from the world because you are created to
      have the very best it has to offer, irrespective of your grade today, and
      that is the sincere truth.</p>
    <p class="article">You deserve the best of God. His best for you may not include graduating
      with a first-class degree from school, but His best definitely include
      graduating with a first-class in life, and that is not debatable!</p>
    <p class="article"><b>2) PAST INJURIES</b></p>
    <p class="article">Life is a battlefield, and one thing that cannot be avoided
      on the battleground is injuries; every soldier is prepared ahead for it.</p>
    <p class="article">You may have experienced injuries and hurts on your campus too, some of
      which may have contributed to your graduating with a third class grade -
      someone lied on you, a lecturer marked you down, a classmate disappointed
      you, a friend betrayed you, your parents denied you some funds, etc.
      Painful as these may be, it is left to you to decide what your reactions
      to these hurts will be.</p>
    <p class="article">In life, you may not be able to control the actions of others to you, but
      you have complete control over your own reactions to their actions. You
      can fold your hands, complain about their actions, allow resentment and
      bitterness to build in you until it turns to revenge. Alternatively, you
      can simply forgive them and let go.</p>
    <p class="article">The latter is easier and more beneficial to you. Forgive all. If you
      think someone else was responsible for your failure or contributed in some
      degree to your catastrophe, please forgive such. Refusal to forgive will
      create in you bitterness, resentment and unforgiveness. These will rob you
      of your glorious future.</p>
