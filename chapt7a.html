	<h3 style="text-align: center;">A FINAL NOTE</h3>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">THERE IS A FUTURE FOR YOU</h3>
    <p class="article">What has happened in the past is not as important as what can still
      happen in the future if you are willing to take the necessary
      steps discussed in the chapters of this book.</p>
    <p class="article">Make a fast start: Begin today. Quit the lamentation; fresh graduates who
      spend today lamenting the mistakes of their campus days will spend their
      future lamenting the mistakes of today.</p>
    <p class="article">Get up and do something. You can still rise up to this challenge. Do not
      fold your hands and watch things deteriorate the more. Make things happen.
      Losers watch things happen but winners make things happen. Be a winner: Do
      something about your life before it is too late. You are the best person
      to chart the course of your life the way you want. Nobody will if you do
      not.</p>
    <p class="article">More often than not, in the real world, it is not those with better
      academic performance that gets ahead with ease, but those who better
      maximize their inborn ability. In the real world, outside the field of
      academics, something much more than college degrees and good grades is
      required; your inborn ability (dominant potentials, hidden talents, or
      whatever it is labelled) matters much more than academic degrees.</p>
    <p class="article">This is not to discredit the educational sector, neither is it to say
      pursuance of a degree is a waste of time and energy. Far be it. The
      importance of education cannot be over-emphasized as some of it has been
      discussed in previous chapters. But the truth still remains that things
      are not as easy as they look outside there. However, this truth does not
      dawn on students until they get out of the enclosure of their university
      compound where everything they need is provided free of charge by either
      their parents, an uncle, an aunt, a guardian, an aristo, or a scholarship
      board.</p>
    <p class="article">Fresh graduates’ over-reliance on paper qualifications must be disabused.
      Our purpose for being educated must not just be limited to simply
      acquiring a high grade certificate, but also to improve our God given
      abilities and develop our inbuilt potentials.</p>
    <p class="article">If this is our purpose, then the inability to get employed in a big
      organization after graduation will neither paralyze our effectiveness nor
      leave us in the class of people called unemployed. This inbuilt ability is
      in everybody and can only be improved on by getting educated, but can
      never be replaced by it.</p>
    <p class="article">Your certificates are not really evidences of what you can do, but what
      your lecturers feel you are good at. All students know this! Therefore, if
      your purpose for going to school is just to acquire certificates, then you
      can as well forget it; because it will not make much difference in your
      exploits in life if you really do not discover what it is you can do to
      make life more meaningful for you and others around you.</p>
    <p class="article">It is gross inadequate for any graduate who is physically fit to parade
      himself as unemployed simply because he did not make a first-class degree.
      It is a misconduct of the highest order. The wealth you need lies within
      you and not in your certificate. The school system is just to furnish you
      with all the needed qualities that will guide you through life. It in no
      way guarantees your success. Your potential does.</p>
    <p class="article">This is the sincere truth. Everyone cannot leave school with a
      first-class certificate. All cannot graduate with a 2:1. Our expectations
      will be sharply cut off if we hope that someday, everyone will. It is so
      natural that some people graduate with the lower grades which have been
      looked down upon by our society.</p>
    <p class="article">What are these ones to do? Are they to resign to fate and accept life the
      way it is? Are they to accept failure as destiny, believe misfortune is
      their lot and withdraw from the struggle to be excellent in life? No. Life
      must still continue; not as a continuous loser, but as one, ready to prove
      that the school system is not strong enough to permanently place an
      everlasting mark of enigma on any student.</p>
    <p class="article">Research has shown that ninety six percent (96%) of graduates that
      succeeds in life succeed outside the area of their academic qualification,
      most times in a field that has little or no relationship with their majors
      on campus.</p>
    <p class="article">Do not let what your lecturers teach you to do hinder you from fulfilling
      the prophetic destiny your creator has designed for you. Do not be
      imprisoned by your certificate. Do not be encaged by your degrees. It is
      not by man’s awarded degrees, it is by heaven’s ascertained decrees.</p>
    <p class="article">Education is not the reason why God sent you to the world. The school
      system is just a transitional phase of your life. The beauty of this phase
      is only in the fact that it makes you fit for anything you find yourself
      doing after school.</p>
    <p class="article">So, take a step, look for something to do after school. Do not wait for
      anybody to offer you something. They will most likely offer you what they
      should offer someone who graduated with the kind of academic degree you
      graduated with - a third-class job, and you will always be at their mercy
      since they will always think they are doing you a favour for giving you a
      job.</p>
    <p class="article">If you think you are a first-class material in any other field aside
      academics, and the school community has not given you an opportunity to
      prove yourself, and worse still, no one is offering you the kind of job
      you want with the kind of pay you desire, then, offer yourself something.
      Be an entrepreneur. Start up something and keep at it. Before you know it,
      the world will come to celebrate you as a first-class material in that
      little corner of yours.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>MAKE IT HAPPEN: YOU CAN DO IT</b></p>
    <p class="article">Take your life in your hands; you can do it. You can enjoy life in a way
      that is beyond the scope of your third class experience. You can be
      blessed by God in a way that can never be limited by your academic
      ability. You can enjoy life as He intends.</p>
    <p class="article">Is life fair? Life has never been, to be candid. Everyone who has made
      it, as well as everyone who has failed will give this same testimony about
      life. Life can never be fair, because it is not designed to be (at least
      the devil will ensure that) until you decide to make it so. If you sit
      reluctantly under an apple tree and expect enough fruits for a meal to
      drop on your laps, you will wait for eternity. You have to take the bull
      by the horn to make things happen.</p>
    <p class="article">Appreciate those little ideas that run through your mind. So much
      potential are in those little ideas of yours. Every big establishment
      today was once a small dream in the mind of someone. You cannot say, what
      you see as a small dream today may be the major change the world is
      craving for. It may be what will put your name in The Guinness Book of
      Records. Do not toy with it.</p>
    <p class="article">People do not usually talk about how we start but how we end. So, be
      willing to start anyhow, but make sure that, come what may, you start up
      something.</p>
    <p class="article">Do not waste time learning the ‘tricks of the trade’. Instead, learn the
      trade itself. Learn how to go about it. Design a game plan. Set a goal and
      plan how to achieve the goal. Make the game plan realistic and workable.</p>
    <p class="article">As it has been emphasized earlier, you will also need enough
      determination to follow through on every of your plan. It won’t come your
      way that easy. You must be prepared to work hard. Hard work pays off in
      the future. Laziness pays off NOW. So, you choose which is better for you.</p>
    <p class="article">Strive always to be better than you are per time, but be contented with
      whatever you get. Do not always attribute what you get to your poor
      academic result. It will always give you reasons to be sad with yourself,
      to be mad with your lecturers, and to hate God. It will make you desire to
      get more in any way possible, right or not.</p>
    <p class="article">You are not the only one who is not pleased with what he makes. Even many
      of those who graduated alongside with you who earned better degrees are
      not too satisfied with what they make too. You may think they are, but, at
      every level of life, people always naturally want more than they already
      have. So, be satisfied with whatever comes your way. Only do not let this
      satisfaction keep you glued to one spot. Endeavour to be better by the day
      so you can earn more in days to come.</p>
    <p class="article">If you will need to do some professional exams, go for an additional
      degree, or add some post graduate diploma, do not delay. Each time you
      increase your knowledge base, you increase your total value and your take
      home pay becomes better for it.</p>
    <p class="article">Your net-worth today is not your self-worth today; it simply is what your
      clients or your boss can afford to pay you. Keep developing yourself on
      daily basis. Someday, sometimes, somewhere, you will meet with someone who
      will look at what you can offer and decide to pay you what you are really
      worth without asking for what you graduated with. One encounter with the
      right person may change your life for life! However, you will not sit down
      and expect the right person to locate you. You will need to keep doing
      what you will need to do to be rightly located by the right person.</p>
    <p class="article">The future belongs to fulfilled dreamers and not dreamers with aborted
      dreams. Have you forsaken any dream because you did not have first-class
      written on your certificate, now is the time to revive those dreams. They
      must not die in your hands. You have what it takes to cause their dry
      bones to live. They still can, if you will do your part. Put the keys
      mentioned above to work and you will see life being restored back to your
      dream. Apply the principles, and your life will be transformed for better.
      Whatever thing you faced in the past which drained life out of your dream
      cannot pose any threat on your way again. You now have in your hand what
      it takes to shine on earth and reign as Kings, having dominion as
      dreamers.</p>
    <p class="article">Dreamers are rulers. Get up and rule the world. It is your time. It is
      your turn. It is your season. We all are waiting for you.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>BELIEVE IN GOD’S ABILITY TO HELP YOU</b></p>
    <p class="article">At this point, all you need is God. He is the only one who can help you
      out. Depending on man will further jeopardize your future. You may know
      men who matters in the society, but you also need to know God that matters
      most in the universe. He is the only one that cannot let you down. You
      need Him more than you need any other man.</p>
    <p class="article">This is the sincere truth: All that you need to live a fulfilled life on
      earth is here on earth, but the earth does not yield its harvest except
      heaven is involved, and for heaven to be involved, you need to have a
      relationship with the God of heavens.</p>
    <p class="article">Friendship with others is important but friendship with God is the most
      important friendship. You need others quite alright; this has been
      emphasized earlier on. However, you need God much more. Men can connect
      you to other men who may choose to either help you or not. But when you
      are connected to God, and He decides to connect you to men, they have no
      choice than to help you.</p>
    <p class="article">This is a crucial decision to make, and this moment is the best time to
      take this all important decision. Do not let the excitement of living a
      first class life become a barrier to your deciding for God. You need Him
      more than all other persons put together. When men make you, they can
      decide to unmake you. But if your making is from the Lord, no one can pull
      you down.</p>
    <p class="article">Give your life to Him today; He can still make more sense out of the mess
      of your life.</p>
