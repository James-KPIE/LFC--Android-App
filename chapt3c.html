	<h4 style="color:red" align="right">CHAPTER 3: Page 3</h4>
	<p class="article">about you by proving to the world that you are not what they said you
      are, that you indeed have something significant to offer your generation.</p>
    <p class="article">Make a move today; an undiscovered gold is not worth the price of a
      discovered chalk put to use. You will never know what you can do if you do
      not make a move.</p>
    <p class="article">The examination of life is not about doing eye-service to get favour from
      the school lecturer or trying to bribe the examiner. The great
      examiner, Life itself, cannot be coerced into giving you a pass mark when
      you do not labour for it. You only get what you deserve. So, take a step,
      and do it today; do it right now.</p>
    <p class="article">Take time to discover yourself; but do not let it end at that. Take a
      step. Make a move. Do something today, and in fact, everyday, towards the
      fulfillment of your goal.</p>
    <p class="article">God has bestowed you with everything you need for what is ahead of you.
      You do not need more capital than you have today. You do not need more
      connections than you have today.</p>
    <p class="article">For now, you do not even need better degrees than you have now. A
      first-class degree is not one of it. If it is, He would have given you.
      All you really need is within you. All you have is all you need. All you
      need is all you have. If you need more as time goes on, He is able to
      provide when the time comes; but for now, you have all it takes to succeed
      at this level.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>NURSE A FIRST-CLASS DREAM</b></p>
    <p class="article">Manâ€™s time on earth is limited. Each closing year, each ending month,
      each rolling week, each setting sun, each tick of the clock shortens his
      days of existence on the surface of the earth and swiftly but silently
      carries him on to his grave unconsciously.</p>
    <p class="article">After your demise, only two things will you be remembered for: what you
      did and what you did not do; your fulfilled dreams and your aborted
      dreams. Nothing will be remembered about the school you went to; nothing
      will be remembered about the course you studied; not much will even be
      remembered about the degree you graduated with. All that shall be left
      shall be what you did and what you did not do, the dreams you fulfilled
      and the dreams you aborted simply because you did not make a first-class.</p>
    <p class="article">Aborted dreams are what you could have done but did not do; dreams you
      could have accomplished with the third-class result and little resources
      you have but have nonchalantly abandoned because you do not have more than
      enough; visions you could have built on to make a world acclaimed edifice,
      but have deserted in a dilapidated stage because of your degree. What
      major thing will you be remembered for after you are gone, that you had a
      first-class in school or that you had a first-class in life?</p>
    <p class="article">If you are living a life without dreams simply because of your present
      academic status, you are living a wasted life. It might be too late before
      you discover this. A life without a dream is a life that just passed
      through the world without any meaningful influence or significant impact
      on its immediate or extended environment. There is no proof of its
      presence on earth.</p>
    <p class="article">That is a meaningless life - a life that is not worth living. If you are
      living such a life now simply because of your academic disadvantages, the
      moment will soon arrive which will close your life on earth, and you would
      have ended up living a wasted life.</p>
