	<p class="article"><b>ENSLAVEMENT BY PAST FAILURE</b></p>
    <p class="article">The problem the devil places on most third-class graduates’ path is their
      past failures, defeats and disappointments. This, most times,
      causes them bitterness and stagnation in life. They would have given their
      dreams a trial, but for their past failures.</p>
    <p class="article">Do not be discouraged if any of your plans in the past had failed, your
      dreams ruined, or your goals aborted. You really desired to leave school
      with something better than what you have today. But there is nothing you
      can do about that now. What you have in your certificate is all you have
      to offer for your past, but it is not all you have to offer for the
      future. No matter what your past may be your future is without stain. Your
      past may be soiled by mistakes but your future is spotless.</p>
    <p class="article">There is a way to deal with failure which most people do not know, and
      this is why they always feel it is the worst thing to happen to a man.
      Once you fail, the next thing to do is not to start regretting your
      actions, analyze the reason for the failure. Find out why you failed in
      the first place.</p>
    <p class="article">Explore the failure. Do not waste it. What were you supposed to do that
      you did not do? What were you not supposed to do that you did? Why did you
      fail the examination? Why did you fail the interview? Why did you lose the
      opportunity? Why were you not as lucky as others? The answers to these
      questions will help you to be better prepared for the next trial at
      success.</p>
    <p class="article">Never use failure as an excuse for not trying again. The mistakes and the
      lessons of the past can be woven into the fabrics of your personality and
      used to clothe and equip you for the future if you really desire to live a
      better life. They will teach you how not to go about a thing. Be ready to
      put those failures behind you and try again. Use the past as a stepping -
      stone into greater successes and not a passage into more failures.</p>
    <p class="article">On a final note: Never feign success. There is nothing very special about
      making mistakes or failing once in a while in life. Honestly face the
      defeat: No man ever succeeded who never once failed. Everybody makes
      mistake. So, why quit because of a mistake? Your mistakes can be corrected
      if you keep on, learn all you can from your failure, make the necessary
      corrections, discover your loopholes, fill them up and proceed again.</p>
    <p class="article">The past failures will not determine your future success as much as your
      present actions. So, do not let your past failure weigh you down
      unnecessarily, it will crumble your dream. Do not let the hurt of the past
      be an excuse for aborting that great dream. Do not lose your enthusiasms
      and zeal because of the failure. The past is past, put it behind you and
      forget about it. Your reaction to this failure will determine whether you
      will still succeed again or fail the more.</p>
    <p class="article">Burry it and do not exhume it again. Failure does not equal defeat unless
      you stop trying. If you allow the thought of the past to take control of
      your life, it will create in you the fear of failure which will hinder you
      from trying.</p>
    <p class="article">Stop looking mournfully into the past. The past is past. It returns no
      more. Spend more time improving the present, thereby investing in your
      future. You may not have a bright past but you have a more glorious
      future. New victories can come out of temporary defeats if you will care
      to overlook the past.</p>
    <p class="article">Setbacks, as it is commonly said, make room for comebacks. Rise up and
      try again. God is willing this time around to make you succeed, but it all
      depends on what you do today. You cannot change your yesterday but you can
      change your tomorrow by what you do today. You cannot change your past
      failures but you can allow them to influence tomorrow’s success either
      positively or negatively.</p>
    <p class="article">The devil knows how colourful and bright your future is, so he will try
      to stop you from going forward by constantly bringing to your memory these
      past failures. Do not encourage him by accepting his vision. Every man
      fails, but dreamers do not tabernacle in their failures. They bounce back
      up and begin again. So, rise up, and prove to yourself and all around you
      that you are indeed an achiever in the making.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>ENSLAVEMENT BY PAST SUCCESS</b></p>
    <p class="article">Past successes are big enough obstacle as past failures. Your success in
      a small part of your dream must not be allowed to become a hindrance to
      the totality of your dream. It must not blind-fold you to a glorious
      tomorrow.</p>
    <p class="article">The greatest enemy of the best, they say, is the good. You will have to
      give up something good if you want something better. Do not let the good
      old days hinder you from moving into the better new days ahead. Do not be
      satisfied with the good or the better. Go for the best. Do not be deterred
      by past achievements; be spurred to greater achievements by past records.
      Let it not be the trap that will keep you glued to one spot.</p>
    <p class="article">Do not be thoroughly satisfied with that little success. If you do, you
      are a failure in the making. That you have succeeded in the first few
      steps toward guaranteeing you live a first class life despite your third
      class degree does not automatically guarantee your success all through if
      you relax.</p>
    <p class="article">Stop looking at what you have accomplished and start looking at what more
      you can still accomplish, you will see there is still more grounds to
      cover. The reason you did not see them earlier is because you are not on
      the lookout for them. What can still be achieved is far much more than
      what has been achieved.</p>
    <p class="article">The reason most preferred their past to the present is because they have
      not seen the future. Stop looking at where you have been and start looking
      at where you can be. There is still a great future ahead of you. If you
      are not aware, your future is glorious; and a glorious future is better
      than a glorious past.</p>
    <p class="article">If you allow your past to be master over your present, your future would
      eventually be buried in the archives of life. Break fresh grounds. Leave
      the old dust whatever it might have been, glorious or inglorious.</p>
    <p class="article">Past glories or apparent past failures must propel you to take more steps
      forward. If you have failed in the past, that does not mark the end of the
      game. You, can still succeed if you give it another trial. If you have
      succeeded at the last attempt, that is not the height of it all, there are
      still greater successes ahead of you.</p>
    <p class="article">So, do not be satisfied with the last achievement. You can’t live in your
      yesterday and expect to be of value today. When you stick to your past,
      you will pass away with the past. Magnifying your past diminishes your
      success, but diminishing your past magnifies your success.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>DISCOURAGEMENT</b></p>
    <p class="article">Lastly, beware of discouragements. This is because enough things to
      discourage you will come before the fulfillment of your dream. People who
      get easily discouraged do not always achieve their dreams.</p>
    <p class="article">Discouragement can come as a result of any of the above-mentioned
      reasons. It may be as a result of poisons from dream killers, inability to
      trust one’s ability, problems and difficulties on the way, weariness and
      boredom, financial problems, discord among partners and the likes.
      Whatever happens, if you really desire to fulfill your dream, do not look
      at the circumstances you are facing, do not be discouraged; press forward.</p>
