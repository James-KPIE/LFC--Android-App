	<h4 style="color:red" align="right">CHAPTER 6: Page 7</h4>
	<p class="article">Do not sit down with arms folded and eyes opened, watching the problem.
      No problem is insurmountable if only you will think. Every dream is
      possible. Every dream is achievable. But unless you think through, your
      true dream becomes an illusion. Activate your mind and activate your
      brain. Dreamers are thinkers. Great dreamers are great thinkers.
      Successful dreamers are successful thinkers.</p>
    <p class="article">Do not delegate your thinking to others. None has ever succeeded using
      that means. Be uncommon, use your common sense. Everyone on earth has it,
      but only a few make use of theirs. The few who makes use of theirs are the
      few uncommon ones around. Be one of them. Frustrate the problem. Do not
      let it overwhelm you. Keep moving in spite of your scars. Every champion
      has a scar. So do not be scared of having one. Soon you will learn to turn
      your scars into stars through the use of your mental ability. This is what
      every champion did.</p>
    <p class="article">When you think you have exhausted every possible solution and there seems
      to be no progress, know this for sure: there is still a way you have not
      tried, it is the only way out. Sit down, think it through and take the
      calculated risk required to move your dream forward.</p>
    <p class="article">Be your own counsellor. Use the advice you give to others to solve your
      own problems. Many people do not. They are experts at counselling others
      in difficult situations but do not remember to counsel themselves when
      faced with challenges. Sit down and tell yourself the problem you are
      facing as if you are seeking counsel from one of the best counsellors
      around. Then honestly try to counsel yourself.</p>
    <p class="article">Do not be afraid of new ideas, new methods or new surroundings. Look out
      for all that can be done and do it. Search out better ways to address
      every mountain and overcome every hill that stands on your way to
      fulfilled dream. Find simple solutions to big problems.</p>
    <p class="article">Do not take it easy. Take it ‘risky’. It is highly risky not to take
      simple risks if you must emerge a first class personality. God can and
      will do the impossible with only those who are willing to take the risk.</p>
    <p class="article">The greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing. The person who risks
      nothing should expect nothing. The equation is simple: He who risks
      nothing does nothing; he who does nothing loses nothing; he who loses
      nothing gains nothing; he who gains nothing has nothing; and he who has
      nothing becomes nothing.</p>
    <p class="article">A man who successfully avoids taking risks may successfully avoid losses,
      but he has successfully avoided profits too. He cannot experience any
      change. Only risk takers are change agents. If you do not take the risks
      expected of you, do not expect the result you desire to see.</p>
    <p class="article">The reward of a fulfilled dream is worth the risk. Risk it. Do not just
      see what you will lose; see what you will gain. It is even more likely
      that you lose nothing and gain all; but it can never be the other way
      round with God on your side. At worst you will gain more, far more than
      you will lose. Take the risks. Where there is a will there is a way. The
      willpower creates the way.</p>
    <p class="article">The way to a fulfilled dream is not very easy. It is filled with valleys
      and mountains. Anyone giving you the idea of a smooth sail is a deceiver.
      This is a more cogent reason risks need to be taken often. People who do
      not take risks on this road will never make meaningful progress.</p>
    <p class="article">Bank on God’s faithfulness in the past. Let it give you enough boldness
      to take the needed adventure into greater realms. David recalled how he
      was enabled by God to single-handedly destroy the lion and bear with bare
      hands which came to snatch his flock away and this made him risked his
      life by facing Goliath the giant. He won at the end. Risk takers seldom
      lose.</p>
    
    <p class="article"><b>PERSIST TO THE END</b></p>
    <p class="article">Goal setting and planning, properly garnished with continual persistence
      on the set goals is a powerful means of realizing dreams.</p>
    <p class="article">Satan’s most successful trick is to get us to believe in false finish
      lines. To make us think we have accomplished a great part of our dream and
      make us relent in our effort when there are still more rivers to cross,
      more battles to fight and more victories to be won.</p>
    <p class="article">He works tirelessly to get us to stop half way and say, ‘Hurray, we are
      through’ and see us pull over the sidewalk only to notice at the last
      moment that the finish line is still miles ahead. Do not fall into this
      trap.</p>
    <p class="article">The most important words now are patience and persistence. All that
      distinguishes a fulfilled dream and an aborted dream is persistence.
      Uncountable numbers of dreams have crashed on the rock of impatience and
      lack of persistence.</p>
    <p class="article">If at first you do not succeed, try, try, and try, again. This should not
      only be a poem to you; let it become a lifestyle. Succeed in spite of
      difficulties. Get tough on issues that are related to your success. Be in
      charge. When the going gets tough, only the tough gets going. Be ready to
      go the extra mile. Every multinational corporation today started as a one
      man idea, who knows, your little idea today can generate into a
      multinational thing. Ensure that this and every other dream that God has
      given you is realized.</p>
    <p class="article">Being persistent is neither easy nor natural. It is difficult, and has to
      be learnt. However, it is the key to the fulfillment of your dream. Your
      persistence will demoralize the devil and loosen his grip on your dream.
      If you are persistent, it will only take some time, but you will always
      end up getting what you want to get in the long run.</p>
    <p class="article">You cannot fulfill your God-given goals or accomplish your God-given
      dream without persistence. You have to persist all the way. Life is in
      phases; do not jump any. Do not be too much in haste. Life is like a
      staircase; you take a step at a time. Your legs have to be carefully
      placed on each stair if you must maintain your balance before reaching for
      the next. Do not jump stairs in your plan for achieving your dream or else
      you will go off balance.</p>
    <p class="article">If you want to live a first class life, take your time; do not rush.
      Skyscrapers are built a brick at a time. Big and mighty trees grow an inch
      per time. Races are won with constant and consistent strides, hence the
      saying, slow and steady wins the race. You need not rush or be in a hurry
      to fulfill this dream. Just pursue the set goals and plans steadily and
      consistently.</p>
    <p class="article">Every idea has a life span, whether long or short. There is a time of
      fulfillment for every dream. No plant grows the same day it is sown. It
      has to take some time to germinate in the soil before shooting out the
      first leaf and some more time before bringing out its fruits. So also with
      brilliant ideas! Every great idea needs time to germinate into maturity.</p>
    <p class="article">Some plants are called the annual crops; they bring out their fruit
      within a year of planting. The biennial crops bring out theirs between two
      to three years of planting, but the perennial crops may take ten years and
      above to germinate. But it is evident to all that the annual and the
      biennial crops do not last as the perennial crops which take longer years
      to reach fruition. The annual crops may produce all their fruits within a
      year and the biennia within two to three years after which they die and
      rot away but the perennial brings out its fruits over and over again for
      many years. Its continual bountiful harvest will make up for the energy
      spent during growth and the time invested.</p>
