	<h4 style="color:red" align="right">CHAPTER 5: Page 3</h4>
	<p class="article">In order to avoid this, always do what you have to do, when you have to
      do it, and the way you have to do it, so as to get what you have to get,
      when you should get it.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>IMPATIENCE</b></p>
    <p class="article">Another similar problem to procrastination, which students who failed out
      of school always have is impatience.</p>
    <p class="article">Dreams crash daily on the rock of impatience. Once they have decided on
      what to do, they really do not give it time to mature naturally into
      something worthwhile. They feel they have lost so much time and so want to
      make up for the time they have lost, either as a student on campus, or as
      an indecisive third-class graduate.</p>
    <p class="article">As much as you should not postpone actions on your dream, you also should
      be willing to give your dream the needed time to develop. You must learn
      to create a balance between postponing your ideas until an unreasonable
      time and being impatient about your dreams.</p>
    <p class="article">So many people lose active interest in their dream if it takes so much
      time to get fulfilled. We are in the Jet age - an age where so many people
      do not want to labour for so long before they get rewards. They want to
      sow in the morning and reap in the evening of the same day, and they
      become impatient and easily discouraged when things do not work out their
      way.</p>
    <p class="article">Impatience makes people quit too soon. It has made so many turn back when
      they are already at the edge of hitting the mark. Do not be injected with
      it. Be ready to stick with your dream until you see its glorious end.
      Nothing can be more rewarding.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>FINANCIAL PROBLEMS</b></p>
    <p class="article">Another great challenge you likely will face is unavailability of funds
      to bring your dreams to reality. Every avenue through which you are likely
      to receive financial aid may just be blocked. Even those who believe so
      much in the dream may not want to part with their money to see the dreams
      fulfilled.</p>
    <p class="article">This may lead you to begin to nurse the thought that the reason why
      others do not want to invest in you and your dream is because you did not
      graduate with a first-class, or that it is probably not a God-given dream,
      convincing you that if it was from God, it would have been a lot easier
      raising the needed fund to sponsor it.</p>
    <p class="article">All of these are not true. The fact that a dream is from God does not
      mean all will go rosy at the beginning. This lack of finance is a major
      difficulty that everybody who has ever seen the fulfillment of their
      dreams faced at one time or the other in their journey in life. The
      experience is not particular to you. Even those who graduated from school
      with a first-class who ventured into building their own dreams rather than
      getting a paid employment have had to face it.</p>
    <p class="article">It comes at three major junctions. It may come at the inception of the
      dream to debar you from starting, it may come midway to hinder you from
      continuing what has been started, and it may come just before the final
      accomplishment so as to hinder you from successfully completing the
      project.</p>
    <p class="article">To make matters worse, most people conclude that this is the end of their
      dreams simply because they have little or no financial muscles to pull the
      dreams through. This is not the best solution to the problem. There are
      alternative avenues you can still explore if you indeed are serious about
      getting this dream accomplished.</p>
    <p class="article">All you need is not money. So, do not abort that dream because you lack
      strong financial backing. If you lack financial resources, you have other
      resources which, if properly monitored and rightly channelled, will help
      in fulfilling your dream. This will make your lack of finance
      inconspicuous and you can still forge ahead with your dream.</p>
    <p class="article">Some of these are educational resources, spiritual resources, natural
      talents, inborn abilities, friends, your integrity and influence in the
      society, and many others like it. Make use of them. Do not just allow the
      vision to die simply because you do not have enough money to carry it
      through today. There may not be enough money today, but there will
      certainly be more than enough tomorrow.</p>
    <p class="article">The God who brought out money from the mouth of a fish has not forgotten
      you, and He will, by supernatural means, provide more than what you need
      for your dream to come through. Just simply do not trust men for your
      financial resources to be met, look upon God. Men may fail you but God
      will not.</p>
    <p class="article">If the devil sees that your lack of finance does not disturb you from
      pursuing your dream, he will attack other areas of your life just to put
      weariness into your soul. He may try to make things seem more difficult;
      he may attack your health, your business, your family, your children and
      even your marriage.</p>
    <p class="article">Never mind. Do not be troubled. He is only trying to scare you away from
      your dream. He is not the roaring lion which he claims to be, he is only a
      barking toothless dog with a roaring lion mask. He can do you nothing. If
      he sees you are not troubled, he will soon leave you for someone else,
      someone who will get scared seeing his masked face.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>CRITICISM</b></p>
    <p class="article">One of the greatest battles you will have to face is that of what people
      will say about you and your dream. Do not expect everybody you meet to
      support your dream. All cannot fall in love with your dream. All cannot
      celebrate you, especially since they are aware that you graduated with a
      third-class.</p>
    <p class="article">Some of them will be too convinced that the reason why you are trying to
      do what you are doing is because this is your last option, i.e. that you
      are stranded, since no good company will employ you and you have no other
      alternative.</p>
    <p class="article">Whether this is true or not, it should not bother you. Life is such that
      there will be those who will criticize you and those who will celebrate
      you; those who will condemn you and those who will commend you; those who
      will encourage you and those who will discourage you, irrespective of what
      you do and what you do not.</p>
    <p class="article">Dreamers are always objects of criticism. They are often criticized for
      their new ideas. So you cannot be exempted. Anytime you want to rise among
      others who are comfortably sitting down and are contented with the
      situation of things, you will create hatred for yourself. Each time you
      desire a change, you will face opposition. This is because every new dream
      generates criticism.</p>
    <p class="article">One thing you must know however is that opposition is a proof of
      progression. Those going nowhere face no opposition. Third-class students
      who have accepted fate and who are making no serious effort to advance the
      course of their lives are never criticized. Men are comfortable around
      them and pleased with their cool-headedness. They even appreciate them for
      knowing their limits and boundaries, and not trying to be too pushy about
      issues.</p>
