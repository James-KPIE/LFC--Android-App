      success. Go right ahead and dream. ,</p>
    <p class="article"><b>TAKE THE RIGHT DECISION TODAY</b></p>
    <p class="article">The only thing that can remove the insults of failing out of school is
      getting a good result in life, and if you must get this kind of result,
      you must be ready to pay the price.</p>
    <p class="article">Life knows nothing about our past, present or future. It only gives us
      the results of yesterdayâ€™s decisions today. What you are
      passing through today is as a result of the wrong decisions you took when
      you were in school; imagine the headaches and discomforts this has caused
      you in recent times! You cannot afford to take another wrong decision
      today as it will affect negatively the future you are trying to protect.</p>
    <p class="article">Taking a wrong decision does not only affect you alone. A wrong decision
      today will affect many of your loved ones and other areas of your life. It
      will affect your wife when you eventually marry. It will affect what kind
      of car you will drive. It will affect what kind of house you will live in,
      and how much comfort you will have in that house. It will even affect what
      kind of food you will be able to afford. Worse still, it will affect your
      children when you start raising kids. It will determine the school they
      will attend, the friends they will keep, and the amenities of life they
      will enjoy, all because of a single decision. Therefore, you must be
      willing to do what you need to do to make your future a better one.</p>
    <p class="article">A failure is a man who wants to have what the successful man has but does
      not want to do what the successful man does. If your life must experience
      a turnaround from now, it must be by your doing. Sacrifice your time, your
      energy, your ego and all that is required. It will pay you off in the
      nearest future.</p>
    <p class="article">If you think you can still live your life now the same way you lived it
      on campus and get away with it, you definitely must be deceiving yourself.
      Doing the same thing the same way over and over again and expecting a
      different result is a proof of a high level of insanity. If you have
      failed in school and want to make it in life, you certainly must do much
      more than you did on campus.</p>
    <p class="article">Do not give up. Start up and keep at it. If you are not yet all you
      desire to become now (you seldom will anyway), do not give up. It is a
      gradual process. Advancement in life is made one step at a time. The first
      initial steps may really not show any sign of significant development, but
      they are in no way less important to the final few steps that will take
      you to the pinnacle of success. You will get there someday if you do not
      give up, and then you will appreciate all that you have gone through in
      time past.</p>
    <p class="article">God has not yet given up on you, so why will you want to give up on
      yourself? The good news is that God does not give up on your situation
      until you give up on it yourself. So you have the final say as regards
      this issue, not your certificate. If you take the right decisions, you can
      still live a first class life with your third class certificate!</p>
