	<h4 style="color:red" align="right">CHAPTER 1: Page 8</h4>
	<p class="article">You may even begin to contemplate on
      engaging in some nasty actions like suicide attempt simply because you are
      focusing on the wrong things.</p>
    <p class="article">Graduating with a third-class is not the end
      of the world. Why will you want to end your life because of that? It has
      not gotten to that yet; there is still more to life than a degree from the
      higher institution. Thousands there are who did not even have the
      opportunity to go to a higher institution in the first place. What then
      should those ones do? Do not let the devil take advantage of a simple
      mistake you made on campus to destroy your glorious future by ending your
      life untimely. Consciously labour to resist such thoughts.</p>
    <p class="article">A wise man once said “you cannot stop birds
      from flying over your heads, but you can stop them from perching on your
      head”. You may not be able to completely stop such thoughts from crossing
      your mind once in a while, especially at a time like this, but you can
      refuse to entertain them, resisting them with all force.</p>
    <p class="article">Do not be deceived; the past or the
      immediate is not the ultimate. What lies ahead is far greater than what
      has gone behind. Just be prepared to fight it out.</p>
    <p class="article">Rather than think about what has happened in
      the past, think about your future. Let your thought dwell more on where
      you are going and what you will need to get there, and not where you are
      coming from. That way, you will live a more rewarding life.</p>
    <p class="article">The Holy Bible encourages that we should
      take everyone of such thoughts captive. You will find this
      instruction handy at a time like this. Each time you are tempted to give
      in to them, summon enough courage to resist them.</p>
    <p class="article">Only entertain thoughts that build up and
      not tear down. Fill your heart afresh each day with words of
      encouragement. Fill up your mind with thoughts, words, musicals, videos
      and images that will build up your confidence again. Watch programs and
      read books that will boost your self-image. All these and many more will
      help put your life back on the right track.</p>
