	<p class="article"><b>BLAME NO ONE</b></p>
    <p class="article">The greatest temptation at this point is to begin to look for whom to
      blame for your predicament. This is very common among students facing the
      challenges you are presently confronted with. When they perform well in an
      examination, they acclaim the glory to themselves by saying ‘I passed the
      examination’. However if they fail, they attribute the failure to the
      examiner, ‘The lecturer failed me’.</p>
    <p class="article">Do not fall for it. Do not blame anyone else for your failure. The
      problem is with you and until you discover it you will not move forward.
      The lecturer did not fail you; you failed yourself, irrespective of what
      your excuse is for failing. To justify blaming your lecturers for your
      academic failure, you can as well credit them for your success in the
      exams.</p>
    <p class="article">Every student who has ever failed has excuses for his failures. These
      excuses are the boundary between them and their success.</p>
    <p class="article">Whatever excuse you have, you cannot be excused. You have failed in
      school, and you need to look for what you need to do early enough so as to
      do better in life. That is all that matters now!</p>
    <p class="article">You cannot blame your lecturer; if you were the best student in your
      class you would have still passed even if he hated you much more. It is
      your weak points that your lecturer capitalized on in order to fail you.
      No one can make a failure of you unless you cooperate with him. You have
      cooperated with him by not preparing adequately.</p>
    <p class="article">You cannot blame your failure on your background. There are people with
      worse backgrounds but with better results. Your progress in life is not
      determined by your background but by what you do despite the background.</p>
    <p class="article">You cannot blame it on the lack of relevant study materials. If you do
      not have enough funds to buy textbooks, you could have borrowed copies
      from friends or from the school library.</p>
    <p class="article">And if you had other things doing that took your time, you could have
      planned your time more properly.</p>
    <p class="article">You are indeed inexcusable. Every other factor notwithstanding, you are
      responsible for your failure. The earlier you accept this fact, the better
      for you.</p>
    <p class="article">However, although you have failed this once, you are not yet a failure.
      Men are not regarded as failures until they admit it themselves, and the
      first signal to show they have admitted failure is that they start blaming
      someone else for their actions. The moment you begin to look for who to
      blame for your failure, you are already becoming one.</p>
    <p class="article">Irrespective of the cause of your failure, always remember that, those
      who designed the failures of yesterday are not in control of the success
      of tomorrow. So, sit up, take the blame, learn the lesson, and make
      progress.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>GOD IS NOT DISAPOINTED IN YOU</b></p>
    <p class="article">Know this for sure; nothing catches God unawares. Whatever
      happens, He knows about it. Sad as this may sound; God knew afore-hand
      that you may not fare better than you did, and He is prepared ahead of
      time to help you sail through it successfully. He is not disappointed in
      you.</p>
    <p class="article">Your parents may not be too happy with your result, considering how much
      they had spent to see you go through school successfully. It may also not
      go down too well with your siblings whose expectations had</p>
