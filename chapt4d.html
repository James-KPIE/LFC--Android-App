	<h4 style="color:red" align="right">CHAPTER 4: Page 4</h4>
	<p class="article">There is a dream you have in your mind. Only you know it and only you can
      accomplish it. You must not be buried in your grave with that dream still
      buried in your heart. You must deliver it.</p>
    <p class="article">It is not too late to start now. Be genuinely interested in that idea God
      has placed in your mind. In it lies your success. In it lies your
      promotion. In it lies your uplift. In it lies your victory. In it lies
      your fulfillment. In it lies your future, and in it lies the first-class
      you never had in school. This dream will take your name from the list of
      third-class graduates to the list of first-class achievers.</p>
    <p class="article">If God will open your eyes to the importance of that dream you have in
      your heart, which though looks irrelevant to your prosperity, (but in
      actual sense is what the whole world is waiting for), you will know better
      than to handle it the way you do. The reason you handle it the way you do
      is because you do not know that what you have in your hand is what will
      make your name a remembrance in every generation.</p>
    <p class="article">That dream in your hand is your life! It must not die. That dream in your
      hand is your future; it must not crumble. That dream in your hand is your
      destiny; it must not crash. Whatever has happened in school is now
      irrelevant. It has become history. Do not let this history repeat itself
      again in your life. This is a new season of your life. This is a new
      millennium with a large deposit of new dreams, visions and ideas, which,
      if well pursued, will change the history of man. These ideas God deposited
      in you will belittle and render obsolete the discoveries made in the past
      millennium. That concept on your mind will make earlier inventions look
      like toys. It will even make those who graduated with better degrees than
      you to begin to desire to be on your payroll if you will keep at it till
      you succeed.</p>
    <p class="article">We are living in the final hours of human history. The end of the world
      is at sight and God is releasing all the remaining ideas in heaven that
      are for earthly good into the hearts of His children. These ideas are not
      given to one single race or color, neither are they reserved for the
      first-class students alone. God has deposited some of them in you. Do not
      watch them rot away simply because you did not meet up to your lecturer’s
      expectations. Make the best use of them.</p>
    <p class="article">Stop wandering about looking for someone to help you succeed. That dream
      in your hand is enough to make you a wonder on earth if you will attend to
      it. That dream which God has dropped in your heart may look seemingly
      impossible, but it is what will take you to the place of destiny in life.
      The idea may sound foolish and unexciting today, but if you keep at it,
      tomorrow, it shall become the talk of the town.</p>
    <p class="article">Dreamers are inventors. Dreamers are creators. Dreamers are rulers. All
      the great men who accomplished great things in life have one thing in
      common, not a first-class degree, but a first-class dream. They are all
      dreamers. If you have a dream, then you are a potential ruler. It may not
      be evident today, but time will prove this right.</p>
    <p class="article">When Joseph told his brethren about his dreams, they were quick to mock
      him. They thought he was out of his mind. But at the end, they came back
      to bow down to him as he had earlier prophesied. Though it took some time,
      he became a ruler over them.</p>
    <p class="article">People may mock you today because of your ‘impossible’ dream, but
      tomorrow, they will come to learn at your feet if you do not give up. They
      may ridicule you today, saying the reason you nurse this ambition is
      because you do not have a good degree to work with, reasoning that if you
      had a first class certificate, you would not have been bothered about an
      unreasonable dream, but time will tell. That vision before you is the
      reason you are sent to planet earth, if you fail to pursue it you have
      failed God. Do not disappoint God. He is not yet disappointed in you
      because of your third-class grade in school, but He could be disappointed
      in you</p>
