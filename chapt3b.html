	<h4 style="color:red" align="right">CHAPTER 3: Page 2</h4>
	<p class="article">Until you know your ultimate purpose in life, you are enslaved by the
      immediate future; every peep into the future becomes scary. This is
      because both your relevance and your identity in your generation are tied
      to your purpose and not your academic qualifications. If you do not
      appreciate this God-given purpose and talents, you will keep on
      depreciating in value in life. But the instant the original purpose is
      discovered, past failures, academic or otherwise, becomes a motivation for
      future success.</p>
    <p class="article">Even if you have a first-class result, that alone is not enough. You need
      much more than a certificate to fulfill destiny. True success only comes
      through the fulfillment of one’s original purpose. If all you can boast of
      now, and you will forever pride in, is just the man-awarded-degree, you
      may live an unfulfilled life, and worse still, you may not know it until
      it is almost too late. Your self-worth is in the potential God has
      embedded in you and not just in what you make out of school.</p>
    <p class="article">Sincerely, the course you study may not be the course to follow. If
      whatever they inputted in you in school does not connect or
      come to terms with what God has imbedded in you, then one should give way
      to the other, and you rightly determine which, the former. Do not let your
      discipline in school destroy your destiny in life.</p>
    <p class="article">The world promotes first-class grades. This is understandable since most
      of those who get it really laboured for it. However, they over-celebrate
      it to the detriment of other grades. So, it is easy to get caught in this
      web of materialism if you do not have it.</p>
    <p class="article">Men rates credentials, but God celebrates potentials. Your credential is
      the evidence of your training in school, but your potential is the
      substantial confirmation of your area of talent in life. When you begin to
      walk in this God-given purpose prepared for you by the creator, you are no
      longer going to be ashamed of your academic qualification and you will be
      very grateful to God for whatever you have passed through. If you realign
      yourself perfectly with your purpose in life, maximizing your talent and
      gifting, the success you struggled to get which eluded you on campus will
      come looking for you with ease after graduation.</p>
    <p class="article">It is that easy. Discover your purpose, build a dream future around it,
      and align yourself with it and good will start coming your way. It is this
      process of discovering yourself that is called ‘self discovery’.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>DO NOT SETTLE FOR LESS</b></p>
    <p class="article">Do not settle for anything less than what God desires for you. Often,
      most men fail to realize their full potentials in life because they do not
      look at the right quarters. They focus elsewhere without understanding the
      full range of what God has placed within them.</p>
    <p class="article">This is the time to appreciate the deposits of God in your life; for this
      is the reason for your existence. There is a great potential for success
      in you. It may really not be academic success, but it is not less
      significant. That is how God has created us all.</p>
    <p class="article">We all do not have to be academics at the same time. Some will have to be
      something else, or else the world will not be an interesting place to live
      in. Hence the saying, ‘varieties is the spice of life’, and fortunately
      academic failure may disqualify you from the best of jobs, but it does not
      disqualify you from enjoying the best of what God has in stock for you.</p>
    <p class="article">You no longer should deceive yourself at this point. The die is cast. It
      is left to you to either prove the school wrong or right; you either
      confirm their assumption that you are truly a failure, or you alter their
      mindset</p>
