	<h4 style="color:red" align="right">CHAPTER 5: Page 8</h4>
	<p class="article">Discouragements arise both to defeat the dreamer and destroy his dream.
      They drain out the energy of the dreamer and paralyze the dream. The power
      of discouragement poisons the soul and weakens the will, but the power of
      encouragement is the lifeblood of success.</p>
    <p class="article">The devil will try to discourage you. He will use all his tricks and try
      all his best, but you will do yourself enough good to avoid every
      temptation to get discouraged. Everyone is tempted like you are, but not
      everyone yields to the temptation.</p>
    <p class="article">Everyone has one form of limitation or the other. It could be limited
      education, poor family background, stories of disappointments from men
      thought reliable, bad economy, financial constraints or other factors
      beyond their control; but they still succeeded. So you also can, with all
      these limitations, succeed. Forget about problems, they will surely come,
      but they will surely not overcome if you handle them wisely.</p>
    <p class="article">If your dream is dead, destroyed or stolen away, pray that God revive,
      remould and restore it. Ask His miracle anointing to touch your dead dream
      and breathe a new lease of life into them so they can live again.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>IN CONCLUSION</b></p>
    <p class="article">If you take your time to study the lives of those who have crossed from
      being a third-class student in school to being a first-class student in
      life, (and there are so many of them that time and space will not allow
      their names to be mentioned and their stories told in this book, that
      would be another volume on its own), you will discover that there is a
      common trend of how they overcame their poor start.</p>
    <p class="article">They started when no one believed in them, not even their family members,
      overcame all the problems, challenges, distractions and discouragements on
      their paths, released themselves from the grip of their past, and were
      patient enough to allow their dream of living a first class life get to
      maturity. Most of them are now the talk of the town. If these people can
      make this happen then anyone can, including you.</p>
