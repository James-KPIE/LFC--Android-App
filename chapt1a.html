    <p class="article" style="text-align: center;"><b>YOU DESERVE WHAT YOU GOT</b></p>
    <p class="article">This statement, coming at a time like this, is not intended to make you
      sad or make you feel worse than you are presently. It is a statement of
      fact. Irrespective of how you feel about it, the truth must be told; YOU
      INDEED DESERVE WHAT YOU GOT.</p>
    <p class="article">You got a third-class result because you deserve a third-class result, or
      better put, you worked for a third-class result. In all labour, there is
      profit, so says the Holy Book. If your labour was worth a first-class
      result, you would have gotten one. Accept the fact, it is needless to
      fight it now; what you laboured for was what you got.</p>
    <p class="article">A number of reasons may be responsible for this. You may indeed have all
      the excuses tenable in the world and acceptable to the heavens why you got
      a third-class result. It does not still change the fact that you have
      graduated with a third class, and that you deserve it.</p>
    <p class="article">Some of the reasons may be that â€“</p>
    <p class="article">- A particular lecturer did not like your face on campus, and so
      influenced your results negatively.</p>
    <p class="article">- You were sick during the final exams and so could not concentrate fully
      in the examination hall.</p>
    <p class="article">- You did not have enough funds like some of your classmates to bribe the
      corrupt lecturers on your campus and so could not get the additional marks
      that some of your mates bought.</p>
    <p class="article">- You could not afford to buy the necessary study materials, you only had
      to manage your class-notes and the limited materials you had access to,
      and this affected your performance in the examination hall.</p>
    <p class="article">- You had some serious challenges from the home front which debarred you
      from giving your academics all it needed.</p>
