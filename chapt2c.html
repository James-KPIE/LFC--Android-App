	<h4 style="color:red" align="right">CHAPTER 2: Page 3</h4>
	<p class="article">Do not settle for less. At a first thought, not having a first-class
      degree may look like an impediment to your success in life or a clog in
      the wheel of your progress; but a second glance will make you believe more
      in the saying that, ‘every disappointment is a blessing’, depending on
      what angle you view it from.</p>
    <p class="article">We often perceive obstacles on our journey in life as blockades, trying
      as much as we can to avoid them, rather than working our way
      over and around them. Most times, we concentrate too much on the obstacle
      that we end up missing out what God has for us on the other side of the
      road.</p>
    <p class="article">This brings to mind the popular saying that “when God closes a window
      somewhere, he opens a door somewhere else not too far from the closed
      window, but most people keep groping around the closed window that they
      never get to see the opened door”.</p>
    <p class="article">You have stared too long at the closed window; look around for the open
      door. There could be a hidden blessing in this disappointment, search it
      out. Do not just see the thorns among the roses; look for the roses among
      the thorns. This will help you to turn every stumbling block into stepping
      stones.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>BUILD UP YOUR CONFIDENCE</b></p>
    <p class="article">First things first; get your mind off the certificate in your hand. It
      will not help you much except there is either a miracle, or your parents
      are highly connected.</p>
    <p class="article">What you need now is to concentrate more on where you go from here with
      or without this certificate, and not where you are now because of it, or
      where you have been with it without any success. Release yourself from the
      hold of the past, move out of it and focus more on the future.</p>
    <p class="article">No doubt, the incident of the past few months that you saw your final
      year results would have eroded your confidence in yourself. This is
      normal, but you no longer should allow it any more. This is because your
      level of confidence in your ability will determine where you go from here.</p>
    <p class="article">Build up your confidence to face the future in order to get the best from
      it. The fear of the future and the fear of failure will hinder you from
      taking calculated risks in order to achieve better things, and this will
      negatively affect you seriously.</p>
    <p class="article">It is a natural thing to start worrying about the future at a time like
      this, but this will in no way help matters. In fact, you will find others
      in your shoes doing a great deal of worrying and you will feel very odd
      and out-of-place not participating in it. It will sound as though you are
      nonchalant and irresponsible if you do not worry in a situation like this.
      But the truth is that the deed has been done and worrying will be the last
      action to proffer a way forward.</p>
    <p class="article">Do not give in to what others in your shoes will naturally do. You may be
      tempted to, but resist it. Do not worry unnecessarily. Do not resign to
      fate. If you can stay calm while there is chaos all around you, then you
      probably stand a better chance of taking charge and you will have complete
      control of the situation.</p>
    <p class="article">Rather than invest your time sitting idly and worrying about what the
      future holds for someone like you, sit tight and take your future in your
      hands, creating what you want out of it.</p>
    <p class="article">You no longer can fully depend on the society to help you. Those who had
      better qualifications have not even been helped yet. Numerous
      Second-class-upper (2:1) graduates are still outside there, combing the
      streets for the ideal job and they are yet to find one. So you will be the
      last person the society is thinking about. If your future must be bright,
      you will need to do the painting by yourself for yourself.</p>
