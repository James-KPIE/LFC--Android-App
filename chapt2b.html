	<h4 style="color:red" align="right">CHAPTER 2: Page 2</h4>
	<p class="article"> For you, all hope is not lost. You have the chance to prove the school
      system wrong. So many others before you have proven them wrong; therefore
      yours will not be the first. God has not given any lecturer or school
      authority the divine mandate to eternally place a never-do-well emblem or
      third-class badge on anybody. Your destiny is not in their hands; it is in
      your hands, and it is not a third-class destiny.</p>
    <p class="article">No man should be allowed to determine your eternal relevance
      in the world just by a two-hour written or oral examination. You may not
      do well in the school’s examination but you can still do well in God’s
      final examination at the close of age - and that is all that matters.</p>
    <p class="article">Your value is in what God thinks of you and not what someone else thinks
      of you. Do not allow any lecturer to relegate you, disregard your talents,
      and downgrade your gifting just by a stroke of his red pen. You have a
      better destiny in life. You have a greater purpose for which the creator
      sent you to the world, and no man can hinder you from fulfilling that.
      Christ’s red blood speaks better things than your lecturer’s red pen, no
      matter how bold.</p>
    <p class="article">Whatever loss you have experienced academically you can gain somewhere
      else. The problem is how to discover where. Once you can discover where,
      the story of your life will change for the better in no time.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>EVERY DISSAPOINTMENT IS A BLESSING</b></p>
    <p class="article">Everyone is born naked, but no one is born empty. Understand your worth
      in the eyes of God. You are precious. You are not a failure. You have an
      intrinsic worth. You are worth far more than your lecturers and examiners
      think you do. They have not yet discovered the complete you; they only saw
      a little aspect of your being - the academic side, and they rushed into
      conclusion that you are not fit to be called a first class material. It is
      now left to you to discover that area of your life which they have failed
      to see. If only you can see yourself in the light of God’s perspective,
      this will be a very easy task for you.</p>
    <p class="article">You have some unique qualities, latent abilities, undiscovered potentials
      and buried talents which your academic pursuit has made you unconsciously
      shut your eyes to before now. Who knows, maybe it is for the sole purpose
      of this all-important discovery that God had allowed your efforts in the
      study room to yield such a low academic heat on the examination result
      board, so as to make you focus on what He desires for your life without
      any distraction of looking for a job with your first class certificate.</p>
    <p class="article">If you had done wonderfully well, or at least done better than a
      third-class, you really may not have picked up this book from the
      bookshelf in the bookshop! You will be more concerned about looking for a
      first class job in a first class company that pays a first class salary
      which befits a first class student like you because you have a first class
      degree, and may never get to fulfil the first class destiny that God
      intends that you will be!</p>
    <p class="article">It does not matter how many times you have failed, academic or otherwise,
      God’s plan and destiny for you never changes. No matter where you are in
      your journey in life. He can help you become what you are destined to be.</p>
    <p class="article">You can be all that you want to be, with or without a first-class. The
      possession of it may be a plus, but if God is on your side, the absence of
      it is not a minus. Let this be registered in your subconscious mind,
      irrespective of your academic result, you are part of the solution to the
      challenges of today’s world. This is hard to believe because of the
      prevalence circumstance, but it is the sincere truth.</p>
