	<h4 style="color:red" align="right">CHAPTER 1: Page 4</h4>
	<p class="article">Your parents may become mad at you. They may withhold some rightful
      privileges from you. Take it in good faith. It would not have been so if
      you had done better than this. That is their best way of expressing their
      displeasure to you.</p>
    <p class="article">It will be rather unfair of you to expect them to rally round you in
      jubilation of your third-class grade as though it were a first-class. They
      are disappointed in you and they have a right to express their opinion the
      best way they feel they can. They have a right to their emotions.</p>
    <p class="article">So, do not try to pick quarrels with anyone who does not identify with
      you in your woes. You will do worse if you were in their shoes. This
      period is like a trying moment for you and you will need to brace up to
      face the challenges.</p>
    <p class="article">You may even be unlucky enough to have around you people who naturally
      rejoice greatly at the failure of others. There is nothing you can do
      about them. You can only be yourself, learn the best from where you are
      today, and pray for a better life tomorrow to prove to them that you are
      indeed not what they think you are, life was just playing a trick on you.</p>
    <p class="article">Since you deserve what you got, you need not blow your head off because
      of what you got. It is too late to cry over spilled milk. Lamenting alone
      will not help you at this moment. It will not take you any further than
      where you are.</p>
    <p class="article">You may see others in your shoes grieving uncontrollably when they
      remember the time, energy and resources they had wasted in pursuing the
      academic degree. However, shedding tears, either genuinely or in pretence
      (so as to gain othersâ€™ sympathy) is not the solution to the problem at
      hand. It will only help you waste more time, energy and resources.</p>
    <p class="article">Contrary to what you think, the past few years you spent in school is not
      wasted. The essence of going to school is not necessarily to graduate with
      good grades alone, although this is an essential part of it because of the
      community we live in.</p>
    <p class="article">If you view the essence of going to school from the perspective of merely
      graduating with an excellent result alone, you will see yourself as a
      failure. Going to school is much more than that.</p>
    <p class="article">What you learn from school is beyond the academic qualifications alone.
      There are other benefits you get from going to school. Some of these are:</p>
    <p class="article">1. You learn basic fundamentals of different teachings and various
      skills.</p>
    <p class="article">2. It enables you to make more effective use of your mind.</p>
    <p class="article">3. You learn good communication skills.</p>
    <p class="article">4. You learn how to relate and live with other people who have different
      beliefs and ideas.</p>
    <p class="article">5. Lastly, being a student helps you to be self-disciplined and behave
      more maturely.</p>
    
    <p class="article">If you view going to school in this light, you will agree that the past
      few years are not wasted years. You may not see the benefits now, but they
      are like investments made into the future. When the time comes, you will
      really appreciate God for letting you have the experience of going to
      school. It will give you a serious edge over others who have never been to
      school, open many doors of opportunities to you, and give you a better
      placement in life in whatever field you finally decide to settle down to.</p>
