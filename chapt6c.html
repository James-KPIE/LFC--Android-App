	<p><b><strong>BELIEVE YOU CAN</strong></b></p>
    <p class="article">Your faith in your dream should be as strong as your faith in yourself.
      Dreamers are optimists. Irrespective of what the past records have proven
      about you, at this point of your life, if your desire to be a first class
      student of life must be accomplished, you will need to start building a
      new faith in yourself.</p>
    <p class="article">Believe in yourself. That thing can be done; yes it can. Not just by only
      a genius who graduated with a first class degree, but by you. You can do
      it. You can reach higher. You can reach further. You can reach deeper and
      you can reach wider than you have ever thought possible if you believe in
      your ability.</p>
    <p class="article">Believe you can. Do not question your ability to accomplish great dreams
      that will make you live a first class life. Do not lose your
      self-confidence, thereby giving room to worry, doubt and confusion. Take
      your mind off the things that seem to be against you which you cannot
      overcome. Why worry about the things you cannot change? Get busy changing
      the ones you can and others will follow suit.</p>
    <p class="article">Have a specific dream. Define your dream. Conceive in your heart a clear
      picture of what you want. If you can conceive it, you can achieve it. If
      you can visualize it, you can actualize it. Whatever your mind can
      comprehend, your hand can apprehend.</p>
    <p class="article">Living a first class life with a third class degree is a matter of
      personal determination. Fulfilling your dream is a matter of your own
      decision. You can decide to live either as a third class graduate from
      your school, or as a first class student of life. Your background, your
      present circumstance of graduating with a third class certificate,
      prevalent challenging situations, and what others say concerning you do
      not influence your dream as much as your determination to succeed. Your
      dream becomes a reality only if you purposely determine that, come what
      may, you will give it all it takes, and more importantly that, you have
      all it takes.</p>
    <p class="article">Build confidence in yourself. Your belief in yourself increases the level
      of your motivation and supplies great stimuli to work hard for the
      fulfillment of these dreams.</p>
    <p class="article">Have no limits. See success where others see failure. Specialize in the
      impossible. You cannot afford to die a third class graduate; you can still
      live a first class life. So, sit up. That dream must not be aborted; it
      must be accomplished. It must not be miscarried; it must be birthed. It
      must not be abandoned; it must be fulfilled.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>ACT</b></p>
    <p class="article">After setting your goals on how to achieve a first class life with your
      third class degree, do not just sit down and wish things would fall into
      place themselves; you will only fall back on the third class platform. You
      have to consciously and painstakingly put things in their rightful place
      by yourself if you want them to fall on the first class base. If you wait
      for them to take their rightful positions themselves simply because you
      have your goal and plans carefully laid out, you will wait till eternity.</p>
    <p class="article">Most graduateâ€™s problem after leaving school is not the inability to set
      goals or plan well, but the inability to act on their carefully set goals.
      Almost every graduate, first class or third class, have nice ideas and
      great dreams, but the challenge is always on how to take the necessary
      steps to transform the dream into reality.</p>
    <p class="article">The devil does not mind your possession of brilliant ideas, setting the
      goals to reach them and planning how to execute them, but he gives you his
      utmost attention the moment you rise to pursue your carefully laid down
      goals so as to achieve your plans. He will do everything possible to scare
      you away from taking the necessary steps, especially the first one.</p>
    <p class="article">That is why, most times, the most difficult step to take is the first
      one. Once you overcome the fear of taking the first step, the other steps
      of actions becomes easy.</p>
    
    <p class="article">Do not be afraid to act on your plans. Endeavour to overcome the fear of
      inability. Once you can, the battle is won. Corresponding actions
      taken after goal setting makes advance planning become
      effective.</p>
    <p class="article">Life is too short; you cannot afford to waste it. You have wasted some
      years back then in the university by not graduating with a degree that the
      society appreciates. You cannot afford to be slothful again.</p>
    <p class="article">You sure know that you cannot be young twice. So you have to make haste
      now in order to achieve your dream. The time is so limited that you cannot
      afford to beat about the bush any more. Get up and do something definite
      which will advance the course of your dream. Do not waste time waiting for
      inspiration forever. Start today, and inspiration will find you.</p>
    <p class="article">Consciously make up your mind not to waste your life anymore; bearing in
      mind that wastage of your time is wastage of your life. Your engagement in
      the things that wastes your time is an unconscious engagement in the
      things that will waste your destiny. Do something worthwhile now.</p>
    <p class="article">Do what you can do when you can do it. You cannot always do it. A time
      will come when it will either be too late, or when you will not have
      enough strength due to age, or when, even if done, will not have as much
      effect as it would have had if done earlier.</p>
    <p class="article">If, since you started reading this book, you have only been enjoying the
      book and have been planning to start up something soon but have not
      actually taken any major step towards fulfilling your desire of living a
      first class life, then you have read too much and have planned long
      enough. Now is the time to do more of acting, or else, the time spent in
      reading this book will be a waste.</p>
    <p class="article">This, most likely, is not the first book of this nature that you have
      come across and have devoured line by line just as you are doing now with
      this. You have probably had encounters with other prolific authors in
      their books encouraging you to do something meaningful with your life
      despite the challenges you are faced with, but you really have not taking
      them too serious. Why this claim? Because you have not yet acted on your
      dream in spite of all that you have heard and read. I will be too
      disappointed if you do the same after reading this also. Have a change of
      mind, do something today about your dream.</p>
    <p class="article">It is not just enough to dream, actualize your dream. A new idea is
      easier to conceive than to deliver. Make sure you deliver the one you
      have. Do not only conceive it; be more interested in its delivery. A lot
      of people remain stagnant because they are satisfied with their
      well-planned goals. Please, do act on yours.</p>
    <p class="article">Dreams do not get fulfilled with clear-cut goals written in ink on paper
      alone. The careful display of well-planned activities on the paper must
      not deceive you into believing that all is well already when in fact
      nothing is being done. Things do not just happen. They are made to. You
      might be on the right track but you wonâ€™t get anywhere if you just sit on
      one spot. Youâ€™ve got to make a deliberate move. Until you make the needed
      move, nothing moves in your favour.</p>
    <p class="article">Take active steps. Pursue your goals with all your vigour. Add work to
      your plans. Be committed to it. Give it all it takes. You might have to
      â€˜step on toesâ€™ in carrying out the dream. Never mind; do it politely. Only
      men who do not leave the same spot can avoid stepping on toes. To make
      progress, you may, once in a while have to step on the toes of those who
      are so comfortable with remaining at the same disadvantaged point. You
      only have to do it with all courtesy and the application of wisdom.</p>
    <p class="article">Do all in your power to safeguard the life of that dream. An unpursued
      dream is an idle idea. A pursued dream is the ideal one. Only what is not
      pursued is not possessed. If you pursue it you will possess it.</p>
