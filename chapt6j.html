	<p class="article">fulfillment. It is the only medium of drawing benefits and strength from
      heaven. It is the key to fulfilling God’s plan for our lives.</p>
    <p class="article">Learn to seek God’s face in prayer. Ask Him every inch of the way. Take
      him into the details of your dream. You naturally call upon Him when in
      trouble and for bigger things. Let Him be a part of every bit of your
      plan. Ask Him to help you. Ask for His grace. With His grace empowering
      you, you can do all things. Take all the difficulties you are facing to
      Him and He will surely give you victory over them. Take your inadequacies
      to Him and He will strengthen you. The one who fed five thousand men with
      five fishes and two loaves of bread can bless your meagre effort and
      multiply it.</p>
    <p class="article">Do not allow anything to discourage you from praying. The devil will make
      you neglect prayer. He fears prayers and dreads its effects. Take time to
      pray when you do not have time for it. Schedule a specific time each day
      to connect to heaven.</p>
    <p class="article">It takes a supernatural force to overcome the natural problems combating
      your dreams. The supernatural force of prayer is readily available to all
      who will want to engage it. When you commit your dream into God’s hand,
      you ask Him to take over and when God takes over an event, the impossible
      happens.</p>
    <p class="article">Heaven will only reach out to assist you if only you can pray. If you do
      not pray concerning those dreams, they will never unfold. More than every
      other thing, pray.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>SENSITIVITY TO THE HOLY SPIRIT</b></p>
    <p class="article">Prayer is the water that irrigates the ground on which your dream
      germinates but sensitivity to the Holy Spirit is the fertilizer that
      enhances its growth. You must work in conjunction with the Holy Spirit at
      all times in order to fulfill your dream. Do not take a step without His
      awareness. Get him involved right from the first stage to the last stage.
      Do not leave him out in any issue.</p>
    <p class="article">Fulfilling your God-given dream is greater than your natural ability. You
      need a supernatural power. This supernatural power can only come from God
      through His Spirit. Every attempt or struggle made by man to be great
      without God’s power is a waste of time and energy. No trans-generational
      dream gets accomplished without Him. He is the senior partner you cannot
      do without.</p>
    <p class="article">You need God far more than you need man in the accomplishment of your
      dream. You need Him more than all other things put together. You need him
      more than anything else. In the pursuance of your dream, He can take the
      place of every other thing, but nothing can take His place. Do not
      insulate your dream from Him and do not isolate it from His spirit. He
      does not need your dream to stay alive; but your dream needs Him to
      survive. Your dreams have nothing to do with His existence as God, but on
      the other hand, to a very large extent, your dream depends upon him for
      its existence.</p>
    <p class="article">If you try to chop wood with a dull axe, you will surely end up with more
      sore muscles than the chopped woods. But if you take your time to sharpen
      your axe head before venturing to start chopping the wood, you will
      certainly end up with more of chopped wood and fewer or none of sore
      muscles.</p>
    <p class="article">The same goes for your dream. If you try to pursue your dream without the
      assistance of God, you will end up wasting away. But if you try to involve
      God from the start, you will end up where you do not expect you could. The
      pace at which you will move will surprise even you. All things will work
      together for your good because God will command everything there is to
      work in your favour.</p>
    
    <p class="article">Listen to the inner voice of the Holy Spirit. Drop all traditions of men
      and allow only the Holy Spirit to lead you. Pay full attention to His
      restraints and obey His leadings. Be sensitive to Him. He is the spirit of
      success. Be at the exact place He wants you to be, doing the precise thing
      He wants you to do, at the exact time He wants. Do only the things He
      commands you to do and go only where he wants you to. Please Him by all
      means and at all times, even if it means stepping on someone else’ toes.
      He is the number one person to be pleased. Others’ convenience comes
      later, even yours.</p>
    <p class="article">It is a stupid thing to try to operate outside God. He is the creator;
      you are only His creation and it is certain that you cannot in any way
      out-think Him. Let Him do the thinking for you. When He does, you will
      experience an increment of your intellectual efficiency: You cannot do
      without Him. Your reach for Him sets your dream in motion. He is the
      merger of the divine and human ability. A drop of His wisdom is greater
      than an ocean of human intelligence.</p>
    <p class="article">The Holy Spirit is God’s gift for a fulfilled dream. To fulfill your
      dream, His power is not optional but necessary. He makes the dreamer
      radiant with new energy, transfigured with a new spirit and more effective
      with new power.</p>
    <p class="article">In such degrees as you are filled with the Holy Spirit, to such degrees
      will your dreams be fulfilled. He is your number one need. He is needed
      and He is enough. Only He can singlehandedly supply all the deficient
      ability and power. He is our sufficiency.</p>
    <p class="article">If you must remain relevant in your area of endeavour, the way out is to
      be sensitive to Him. No matter the circumstance or situation you face, if
      you yield to Him, the situation will bow to you. Let Him lead you each
      step of the way and your victory is sure.</p>
    <p class="article">God is the foundation of a fulfilled dream. He has committed himself. He
      has promised to lead to the place of fulfillment through the Holy Spirit.
      Let us take advantage of His promises.</p>
    <p class="article">He is set to help you fulfill those dreams if you will identify with Him.
      Dreams without Him end up as illusions. You need Him to be a fulfilled
      dreamer. And the only way you can have him is to invite Him to your life
      by surrendering your life to him and handing over your dream to Him. Once
      you do this, you have entered into an everlasting divine covenant to
      succeed with your dream, and he will definitely not let you down.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>IN CONCLUSION</b></p>
    <p class="article">These three things you cannot afford to waste at a time like this:</p>
    <p class="article"><b>(1) Your Time</b></p>
    <p class="article">The more time you devote to any task (positive or negative) the better
      you become in it and the more progress you make on it.</p>
    <p class="article">Devote more time to whatever you decide to lay your hands on. Make every
      minute count. You are where you are today because you did not put value
      into each of the minute you spent before now. If you must have a better
      result in life than the one you had in school, you must be ready to invest
      more into your time.</p>
    <p class="article">Fill every moment with things that will benefit your future and not just
      things that will be relevant for now. It will surely pay you eternally.</p>
