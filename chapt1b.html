	<h4 style="color:red" align="right">CHAPTER 1: Page 2</h4>
   <p class="article"> - Examination questions came from chapters you did not consider
      important enough to read. To your detriment, the examiner intentionally
      decided not to set questions from the part of your note that you have read
      inside out.</p>
    <p class="article">- The Examination Invigilators were too strict. They did not allow you to
      execute your carefully laid out plans in the examination hall. No talking,
      no shaking, no exchange of scripts, no looking sideways, no moving around,
      ... ... .... the rules were just too much.</p>
    <p class="article">- This year’s Examination Marking Scheme was too tough. It was worse than
      last year’s. If you were assessed based on the previous year’s scheme, you
      would have fared better.</p>
    <p class="article">- The Examiners were not lenient with questions. The questions were not
      only too much but also too tough. There was no way anyone could have
      answered them all in the given time.</p>
    <p class="article">- Your heartthrob broke your heart just before the examination, and this
      was a serious distraction to your preparation for the examination.</p>
    <p class="article">- You had a weighty spiritual problem that needed urgent attention but
      you could not spare out time to address this before the examination
      started.</p>
    <p class="article">- Your background affected you. Your parents never appreciated education.
      They do not even know the difference between a first class and a third
      class since they did not attend a higher institution themselves.
      Therefore, they could not encourage you enough.</p>
    <p class="article">- You had other important things doing that took much of your time. You
      were a sportsman on campus. You were into campus politics. You were doing
      serious money-making business on campus. You were too involved in
      religious activities in school. etc.</p>
    <p class="article">- Your parents were not fully supportive. There was nothing you ever
      requested from them that they gave to you when you needed it.</p>
    <p class="article">- You had a serious financial crisis during the examination.</p>
    <p class="article">- You were not cut out for school. You were forced into it. You would
      have done something more important with your time if allowed.</p>
    <p class="article">- Luck was against you.</p>
    <p class="article">All of these excuses are irrelevant and not needed again. Excuses are
      self made imprisonment. Do not imprison yourself with one. What matters
      now is to face the truth squarely - you have failed in school; and you
      failed because you deserved to fail.</p>
    <p class="article">Left to you, you really think you tried your best!</p>
    <p>- You did all of your assignments and submitted them at the required
      time.</p>
    <p class="article">- You did all the experiments you were supposed to do in the laboratory
      and wrote your report on time.</p>
    <p class="article">- You attended all of the lectures and practical sessions required of
      you.</p>
    <p class="article">- You read all of your notes for the tests and prepared well ahead for
      the exams.</p>
    <p class="article">- You even attended tutorials organized by your classmates,
      extra-moral classes by the lecturers, and borrowed study materials both
      from friends and from the school library.</p>
    <p class="article">You did your very best, and you expected a more brilliant result than
      this. But the expected result never materialized. The reason is simple;
      your best was not enough to sail you through the torrent of the
      examination storms. You worked as hard as you could, but things did not
      just go as planned.</p>
    <p class="article">You really think some of your classmates deserved to fail because they
      did not put in as much effort as you did; but not you. Your case was
      different; you tried your best. Sad to think, those whom you think
      deserved to fail woefully ended up performing far better than you did.
      They did not prepare well enough, but they passed. And you cannot still
      explain why, of everyone in your class, you should fail!</p>
