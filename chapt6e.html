	<p class="article">However, do not be tempted to copy his dream verbatim unless you have his
      permission; it is a criminal offence called plagiarism, lifting, piracy or
      bootlegging, depending on the particular field of endeavour.</p>
    <p class="article">Only learn from him so you can understand how he did it. Learn from his
      successes, his failures and his mistakes. Know where, how and why he went
      wrong in order not to tread the same path. Also know where, how and why he
      succeeded where he succeeded. You will definitely need this information.</p>
    <p class="article">Just one piece of information can turn a failure into a success. What you
      know determines where you will go, how quick you will move and how far you
      will get. So, make research. Find out about your dream. Consult relevant
      authorities.</p>
    <p class="article">Irrespective of their age, younger or older, be humble enough to learn
      from those who are already living a first class life through the
      achievements of their dreams. Do not let your pride destroy that precious
      dream. Be cool headed enough to learn. Get all the details you can from
      them.</p>
    <p class="article">All you know is all you need to start up on that dream, but it is not all
      you need to make a first class personality out of you; you need much more.
      To keep a continuous progressive chart, you need much more than you know
      already.</p>
    <p class="article">Good information about your dream gives you the power and the ability to
      get successful results. So, do not hesitate to draw strength and knowledge
      from what they know, irrespective of what they think about you. Success
      breeds success you know? If you do this, their success will rub off on
      you. Remember, the bestselling author, Robert Kiyosaki had a Rich Dad to
      learn from. Every celebrated athlete has a coach. Go get one if you desire
      to be celebrated.</p>
    <p class="article">You may begin to have a feeling that you are not polished enough, or that
      you do not have what it takes to actually live a first class life, and
      probably that you are not the right candidate for the job. These types of
      feelings are not peculiar to you. It had, at one time or the other
      afflicted everyone who is great today. All they did was to disallow it
      from overcoming their belief in themselves.</p>
    <p class="article">This is why you also will need to work at developing yourself rather than
      hiding who you really are, or lamenting over your third class degree. Give
      so much time to the improvement of yourself that you have no time to
      criticize the dream of others or listen to the words of critics about your
      dream.</p>
    <p class="article">If you want to be the best in the area of your dream, then you have to
      acquire every skill possible. Knowledge provokes wisdom. If you know what
      to do, you become wise. Until you know, you cannot be known. Understanding
      your dream makes you outstanding among your fellows.</p>
    <p class="article">Ignorance is a deadly disease. It puts a man in bondage. It limits
      everyone in its grips. To avoid its limitations, acquire available data in
      the area of your pursuit. You can suffer even with having everything you
      need for the success of your dream if you lack the right understanding
      needed. Men who lack insights into their dreams end up being sorry sights
      with their dreams. So, aspire to be the best you can be in your endeavour
      by learning all you can from everyone you need.</p>
    <p class="article">Before you can attain your highest height, you will have to obtain the
      highest knowledge needed. You won’t have a fulfilled dream unless you are
      thoroughly informed about your dream. Nobody excels in any area of life
      without the needed secrets. Whatever it costs you, get the trade secrets
      of your dream.</p>
    
    <p class="article">Learn new ideas and better techniques: Dependence on the little you know
      will get you nowhere. Never be satisfied with the level you are on. Nobody
      knows all they need to know. Everybody needs to learn something to become
      someone. If you hold onto your third class knowledge, you will remain a
      third class citizen forever. If you must live a first class life then you
      must have first class information.</p>
    <p class="article">Develop your techniques and abilities. Do not assume anything. Pursue
      every necessary information. Seek counselling if need be. Read
      inspirational materials and biographies of those who have gone before.
      Invest whatever is needed on materials that will build you up. Buy books
      that will give you the facts and information you need. Buy tapes. Rather
      than spend unnecessary money repackaging your wears so as to increase your
      outlook, invest much more in personality development. It will give you a
      greater reward.</p>
    <p class="article">It is never too late to learn. If you will need to go to a training
      school, please do. If you need to learn from someone, learn. If you need
      to get a professional certificate, please do. Do not be a half-boiled egg,
      a semi-illiterate in the area of your dream. Avail yourself of seminars,
      conferences and retreats which will build you up and give you more insight
      into your dream. Buy literatures and journals.</p>
    <p class="article">Be willing to pay the price to make your dream come true. Pay the price
      to find out what you need to know for your dream to succeed. Every
      investment done on your dream is worthwhile. Sooner or later, it will
      yield great dividends.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>GET PARTNERS</b></p>
    <p class="article">You have a vision of living a first class life with a third class degree.
      This vision may start with you alone; but if it must be fulfilled, it
      should not end with you alone. You will need people to work with to help
      you fulfill this dream.</p>
    <p class="article">You need people around you who will support your dream and make the job
      lighter for you. The Great Book says, ‘Without vision the people perish’.
      But the reverse is also true, ‘without people, the vision also perishes’.
      No dream succeeds in the absence of people.</p>
    <p class="article">Reject the trap of isolation; co-operation is essential for the success
      of any dream. There is little you can singlehandedly accomplish. You need
      people to help. So, learn to attract others who are able to help you
      achieve your dream. Do not try to do it alone. Conquer your pride.
      Establish the needed networks with others.</p>
    <p class="article">You need people to salvage your dream from peril. Every Elijah needs an
      Elisha to run errands for him: Every Moses needs an Aaron and a Hur to
      lift up his hands: Every Joshua needs a Caleb to give him moral support:
      Every David needs a Jonathan; and Every Paul needs a Barnabbas, or a
      Silas. You also need men to lift up your hands when they are weak. Even
      Jesus, the greatest of all, needed the twelve disciples. So, do not think
      your dream can survive on the rock of isolation.</p>
    <p class="article">Great power and strength become available to you when you have others who
      are in support of your dream working together with you for its success.</p>
    <p class="article">Since the people you associate with matters a lot in fulfilling God’s
      purpose for your life, do not move with people who will dampen your zeal.
      Be choosy. Work with people who are in support of your dream. If you lack
      enough motivation from people around you, your zeal may die, your fire
      extinguished, your hopes dashed and your dream destroyed.</p>
