	<h4 style="color:red" align="right">CHAPTER 5: Page 4</h4>
	<p class="article">However, a third class graduate who will not accept the status quo will
      be criticized for everything he tries to do. The criticism you will face
      is a proof that you are making advancements and this shows that the future
      of your dream is glorious. No man criticizes people at the edge of
      failure; they will rather pity them. Only those who command attention
      attract criticism.</p>
    <p class="article">Ignore all destructive criticisms. If you are too conscious of what
      people say about you, you will never get better. If you devote your time
      to what men say about your dream, you are opening up the dream to too much
      danger. Once you begin to hear the words of men, you are likely to stop
      hearing the words of God and when you stop hearing the word of God about
      your dream, you put yourself in a very tight corner.</p>
    <p class="article">Deliver yourself from the trap of the opinion of men. Do not yield to the
      pressure of public criticism. Run your dream irrespective of man’s
      opinion. Let your love for your dream dominate your fear of what others
      think about it.</p>
    <p class="article">Lastly, aside neglecting the criticisms, consciously avoid every
      destructive critic you meet. Since you now know they are out to destroy
      your God-given dreams, do not get too close to them. Severe every possible
      relationship with them; they are Satan-motivated, evil-dominated and
      devil-inspired. Endeavour to separate yourself from the gatherings of the
      ones you can avoid.</p>
    <p class="article">You may not be able to cut off or avoid all of them. Some of these people
      may be so close to you so much so that it is difficult not to relate with
      them constantly, but you can decide the way you relate with them in order
      to keep your dream alive.</p>
    <p class="article">Learn to live with the critics you cannot avoid. Adopt the right attitude
      to them. Do not allow your mind to dwell on their destructive criticisms.
      Do not give their comments any room in your heart. Treat their words as
      unwanted visitors - discard them. Do not welcome their criticisms, and
      wisdom demands that you do not also react violently against these critics,
      since these are not just faceless people. They are people you know and
      will always have around you, at least for a while. So, apply wisdom.</p>
    <p class="article">On the last note, do not waste your time fighting any critic, whether
      known or unknown, or trying to defend yourself against their criticisms.
      If you fight back to justify yourself, you may lose, and this may affect
      your morale negatively. Simply keep quiet and let peace reign. Time will
      prove you right.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>DREAM KILLERS</b></p>
    <p class="article">These are worse than critics. Critics only innocently point out faults in
      your dream, make unpalatable remarks and pass unfair judgment about your
      dreams. But dream killers are out for one single mission, just as the name
      implies, to make sure your dream never materialize by all means.</p>
    <p class="article">They are ‘PhD holders’ in assassinating dreams. It might be disastrous if
      you allow them get a grip on your dream. They will downsize and water your
      dream so much that it will become so watery that it will even become
      tasteless and worthless to even you.</p>
    <p class="article">Dream killers may not necessarily be some form of unseen forces or
      demonic agents. They are humans who just take special interest in plotting
      the downfall of dreams that could change the future for better.</p>
    <p class="article">This is why you should not share your dreams with just anyone. Be careful
      who you discuss your goals and aspirations with. Not everyone wants your
      success; some really desire that you fail, and they will not hide it from
      you. They are really happy that you failed out of school, although they
      may not let you know this.</p>
    <p class="article">Their ultimate goal is actually to see you fail out-rightly in life, and
      they will not rest on their hoarse until they see this done. If you keep
      discussing your dreams with such, you are a goner.</p>
    <p class="article">One sure way to identify a dream killer is this: they will never for once
      see anything good in your dream, no matter how bright its future looks. A
      critic may be convinced to reasons with you overtime, either reluctantly
      or wilfully, but a dream killer never will.</p>
    <p class="article">Everyone who discourages you more than encourage you is a dream killer.
      There are many who will come up with thousands of reasons why you cannot
      do what you desire to do. They will try all they can to make you desert
      that idea. They will paint a bad picture of the future of the idea; tell
      you how impossible it is to accomplish such dream in such an environment,
      with such little qualification and without enough assistance. They will
      tell you about the giants in the land, the Red Sea on the way, the wall of
      Jericho ahead and the renowned River Jordan. They will magnify the
      problems and shut your eyes to the rewards. They will give you a long list
      of all those who have tried working on the same dream or something similar
      and have failed, but none of those who succeeded at it.</p>
    <p class="article">All they are after is just to get you to surrender the pursuance of your
      goal. If they can get you to do this, they have achieved their ultimate
      goal. Whatever ‘folktale’ you are told does not matter to you much. The
      Holy Book calls them vain babblings and old women’s fables which you must
      not give heed to.</p>
    <p class="article">Never give their words a thought. The fact that other third-class
      graduates have failed in the projects some of them embarked on after
      school does not mean that you will also fail in yours. After all, there
      are records of other third class graduates who have made it, and there are
      also records of some first-class graduates who have failed in major
      projects in life.</p>
    <p class="article">Others’ failure in an event has no place in determining either your
      success or your failure in the same. Do not let them use other third class
      graduates’ failure to set the limit for your success in life. You are a
      different entity, with fresh zeal, new drive, great passion, and clean
      aspirations. Therefore, shun their negative opinions, bad reports and evil
      expectations.</p>
    <p class="article">Most of the people who will fight tooth and nail against the success of
      your dream are those you least expect, those you think should be the
      forerunners, and those from whom you expect to receive the greatest
      support. Relax; let this not disturb you. Whether they support you or not
      does not really matter as long as God supports you.</p>
    <p class="article">Every time you consult the wrong person you are sure of getting the wrong
      advice. And every time you get a wrong advice it leads you the wrong way.
      The farther you go on the wrong direction, the more difficult it is to
      make it in life. Therefore, separate yourself from everybody who does not
      have a meaningful idea, suggestion or advice that will take your dream
      forward.</p>
    <p class="article">If you notice that some of the people you trusted most are beginning to
      foresee the downfall of your dream in advance and are already predicting
      same, it is time to turn away from such completely. Do not take counsel or
      advice from them again.</p>
    <p class="article">No matter how close you are to them, completely separate yourself even
      from your own people who do not want to identify with your dream lest they
      become stumbling stones to your dreams, or thorns that will choke life out
      of them. You can learn to live with criticism but you cannot learn to live
      with dream killers. For your dream to live, dream killers must leave.</p>
