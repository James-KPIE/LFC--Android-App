	<h4 style="color:red" align="right">CHAPTER 3: Page 4</h4>
	<p class="article">Every great invention in the world today started out as a dream, not only
      from the minds of those who were the best of the bests in the classrooms
      alone, but also from those who were willing to contribute their quota to
      better the lifestyle of humanity, irrespective of what their lecturers
      think about them.</p>
    <p class="article">These are the two sets of people on the earth - the dreamers and the
      spectators, academic results notwithstanding. The dreamers make things
      happen, but spectators watch things happen.</p>
    <p class="article">Do not be a spectator in life be a dreamer. History is filled with such
      people: Men who have done extraordinary things and changed the course of
      their generation through the fulfillment of their dreams. Your world is
      waiting for you, stop wasting away.</p>
    <p class="article">So many have attempted to give a detailed and generally accepted
      definition of this word called ‘dreams’ but have come up with a
      conglomeration of words of various parts of speech to illustrate their
      idea and drive home their point.</p>
    <p class="article">For the singular purpose of this study, it shall be defined simply thus:
      Dreams are invisible ideas in the minds of creative thinkers (first-class
      graduates, third-class graduates, or staunch illiterates) that can be
      processed into visible blessings which men can relate with.</p>
    <p class="article">If well explored, a dream can become the tool that closes the door on
      your past, gives you the drive for the present and inject you with the
      needed aspirations for the future. It builds hope and expectation for
      great things to come. It is the thoughts that totally overtakes and
      motivates you towards your destiny, despite your success or failure in
      school.</p>
    <p class="article">Your dream is your passport to the future, not your certificate. Your
      dream is your destiny, not your degree. Your destiny, simply put, means
      God’s purpose for your life: your appointed and ordained future. It is
      what God has in mind that you will become, the sole reason why you were
      born. When you discover it, you will command public attention but if you
      do not, you will miss your place in destiny and when you miss your place
      in destiny, you will be thrown into the archives of life.</p>
    <p class="article">A ‘dreamless’ man is a ‘futureless’ man. Your dream determines your
      future. Your dream determines your placement. Your dream determines your
      greatness. Your dream moulds your destiny. Your dream creates a pathway to
      get you to your destination early in life.</p>
    <p class="article">Majority of the failures in the world is caused through lack of dreams
      than through lack of good grades or lack of ability. Lack of dream is
      worse than lack of degrees and poverty of purpose, as is commonly said, is
      more destructive than poverty of purse.</p>
    <p class="article">Life is not as difficult as it appears. The issue is that many have no
      goal, no dream, and no aim. Without these things, life is a waste. Lack of
      dreams and vision is a formal invitation to the peril of irrelevance among
      peers.</p>
    <p class="article">If you do not have a dream in this present predicament that you are, you
      have no reason for living. A dream is all you need for a turnaround in
      life. With that dream, you can be what you want to be. With that dream,
      you can get what you want to get. With that dream, you can have all you
      want to have at your disposal. With that dream, you can get much more than
      a first-class result will offer you.</p>
    <p class="article">It is possible to have a quick flash of heaven-sent, earthly-needed,
      wealth-generating idea cross your mind from time to time. Your ability to
      understand them on time and pursue them with all of your might makes you a
      dreamer.</p>
    Dreamers are men of ideas; men of ideas are men with dreams, and
    men with dreams are men of destiny. They may neither be recognised nor
    awarded a first-class degree in their respective schools at their graduation
    ceremonies, but life itself will always award them a first-class material
    before their demise because of their contribution to planet earth.
    <p class="article">Anyone who lacks a dream is irresponsible. It does not matter whether he
      has a first-class or a third-class degree. It does not even matter whether
      he lives in the ghetto or in a penthouse; if he has no dream, he has no
      future. He will soon be expelled from the list of the history makers the
      world needs.</p>
    <p class="article">Your dreams will lead you to boom but lack of it will lead you to doom.
      Your dream will cause an explosion in your life and everyone around you
      will be glad to associate with you. Even those who have mocked you before
      for graduating with a poor result will want to identify with you and
      become your friend.</p>
    <p class="article">History is for dreamers, if you are not a dreamer, you are a goner.
      Dreamers rule the world. Dreamers are the architects of the world to come.
      The dreamers who lived yesterday made the world that we live in today. The
      dreamers who live today will build the future, which we will live in
      tomorrow.</p>
    <p class="article">If you refuse to dream today, the generation to come will miss something
      which you have been created to contribute to their well being. They may
      not really be able to pinpoint what it is, but your creator does, and will
      certainly not be too pleased with you for denying men what you are meant
      to offer them. Dreamers are the saviours of the world. All the world needs
      are more of such.</p>
    <p class="article">Live a purpose driven life; be a dreamer. God appreciates first-class
      graduates, but He respects dreamers as well, and He rewards them too.
      Dream and dream well.</p>
