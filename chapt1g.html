	<h4 style="color:red" align="right">CHAPTER 1: Page 7</h4>
	<p class="article">Do the little things that will attract others to you. Smile, you have no
      cause to frown; failing in school does not mean failing in life. Dress
      neatly, you are not mourning; only those who are mourning wears sack
      cloth. Spray some perfume, it puts you in a better mood; and you really
      need to be in a better mood for better thoughts to flow through your mind.</p>
    <p class="article">Say hello first, make the effort to be friendly. You do not know what God
      has in stock for you through the other person. He may be the angel you
      have been praying for. The more you concentrate on your academic result,
      the more insecure you will become. To get the confidence you need, look
      beyond the certificate.</p>
    <p class="article">The worst set of people to have around you now is the set that criticize
      every one of your moves and remind you of your past failure. Surround
      yourself with men who believe in you. This is not the time to start
      forming a pity-party. What you need now is more of people who believe in
      your ability. Anything else will rub off your self-esteem and your faith
      in yourself. Always have around you those who will encourage you, cheer
      you up, celebrate your ideas and contribute to your progress. These will
      make life more adventurous and rewarding for you.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>FIGHT EVIL THOUGHTS</b></p>
    <p class="article">Guard your mind; let it not wander aimlessly in circles. Define its
      boundary. Constantly resist and rebuke every thought that:</p>
    <p class="article">(1) Portrays unreasonable anxiety about tomorrow,</p>
    <p class="article">(2) Envy those who did better than you,</p>
    <p class="article">(3) Paints hopelessness about your present circumstance,</p>
    <p class="article">(4) Brings guilt about your past errors,</p>
    <p class="article">(5) Creates depression and fear of what the future holds,</p>
    <p class="article">(6) Produces bitterness towards those you feel are responsible for your
      predicament.</p>
    <p class="article">Refuse to identify with all the lies the devil may want to feed you with.
      Lies like,</p>
    <p class="article"><i>‘You are good for nothing’;</i></p>
    <p class="article"><i>‘You have jeopardized your future’;</i></p>
    <p class="article"><i>‘Nothing good can come your way again since you did not make a
        first-class’;</i></p>
    <p class="article"><i>‘Your life is ruined’;</i></p>
    <p class="article"><i>‘You are in a real mess ‘.</i></p>
    <p class="article">All these are lies from the pit of hell. He only wants to take over your
      mind, do not allow him. Purify your thought. Do not permit any futile or
      foolish thought to take charge of you around this time of your life.</p>
    <p class="article">If you allow these negative emotions to overwhelm you, your life will
      experience more retrogression, and will finally be brought to a halt
      sooner than you envisaged. Do not put yourself under such bondage.</p>
    <p class="article">Such overly sensitive thoughts about the issue at hand will end up
      creating a feeling of great insecurity which makes your weaknesses become
      more pronounced than your strength. Once your weakness becomes more
      pronounced than your strength, your doom looms.</p>
    <p class="article">This is because whatever dominates your mind dictates your actions.
      Whatever dictates your actions controls your life. Whatever controls your
      life determines your final end. So, do not listen to the thoughts that
      bring you fear, worry, and insecurity. Those are not from God.
      Constant allowance of such thoughts will erode your self-confidence.</p>
    <p class="article">This is neither the time to lose your head nor the time to lose your
      faith in God. If all you do is get anxious and get worried, it will
      demoralize you the more, and at this stage, that may be detrimental to
      your health.</p>
