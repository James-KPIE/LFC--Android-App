	<h4 style="color:red" align="right">CHAPTER 6: Page 2</h4>
	<p class="article">Plan your time, plan your day, plan your week, plan your month, and plan
      your year. Other resources available at your disposal are directly or
      indirectly dependent on your ability to plan your time in line with your
      techniques. A proper planning of your time, coupled with a good
      organization of your techniques are what it takes to soar with your dream
      and become a first class personality in life.</p>
    <p class="article">Without detailed plan, life becomes a gamble. Your life will be
      controlled by all situations and external circumstances. You will only be
      going back and forth, wandering about aimlessly. You do not know when to
      do what and what to do when. You do things arbitrarily; anything goes, at
      any time, in anyway, by anyone, for any purpose. This leads no one to
      nowhere.</p>
    <p class="article">If the fulfillment of your dream is your priority, you will think well
      enough and design ways to attain them. This has always been the norm:
      first class dreams soar only on first class plans. Noah had a plan for his
      ark. Moses had one for the tabernacle. Joshua had for his battles. Solomon
      had for the temple too. God had a plan in place to save the world
      immediately Adam and Eve sinned. He is also in heaven planning the
      structures and space to accommodate all that will make it to heaven. You
      also cannot succeed without a concrete plan.</p>
    <p class="article">Do not forge ahead unless you have planned ahead. To have a ready-made
      plan is to act wisely. Carefully, planned strategy prevents from ending up
      in tragedy.</p>
    <p class="article">Dreams are not produced in microwaves. Anything that will last will
      require enough time for preparation; this is the time for planning. When
      you have a detailed step by step plan, it propels you every step of the
      way.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>GOAL SETTING AND PLANING</b></p>
    <p class="article">Goal setting and planning are too intertwined to be separated. Both are
      the foundation stone for any dream that must succeed.</p>
    <p class="article">Every dreamer is a planner. All visionary are goal setters. Setting goals
      without proper planning makes the goals unachievable. Proper planning
      without set goals keeps the dreamer wondering whether he has achieved his
      goal or not, since he does not know what his goal is in the first place.</p>
    <p class="article">Setting your goal is deciding what you want while planning is preparing
      ahead of time how to go about it. In this case, your goal is to end up a
      first class personality in life, despite graduating with a third class
      result in school, and your plan should contain detailed steps to take to
      achieve this goal. The goals can be further broken down with commensurate
      plans to achieve it.</p>
    <p class="article">Goal setting is defining your goals clearly on paper while planning is
      having a clear-cut, detailed plan of ways to achieve the set goals. When
      such decisions are made, it will be easy to achieve goals with little or
      no stress.</p>
    <p class="article">Planning and goal setting together enhance the quality of your work and
      determines the rate at which you move, especially at this early stage. It
      is useless to be mindful of time if there is no end towards which you are
      running. Unless you know where you are heading to and how to get there,
      you do not just jump into the cockpit of an airplane and take off. Goal
      setting gives you the end view, while planning monitors your progress per
      time.</p>
    <p class="article">Goal setting and planning require vigorous thinking. However, you need
      not be scared because of the mental alertness needed. It will only make
      your life better.</p>
    
    <p class="article"What other things precisely do you want to achieve and when exactly do
      you want to achieve them. Start tabling your plan on how you want to
      achieve them. Life is easier that way.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>BREAK DOWN YOUR DREAM</b></p>
    <p class="article">Most third class graduates easily get intimidated and overwhelmed by the
      size of a big dream and the amount of time it will take to accomplish it.
      This is why they always easily settle for something small and sizeable.
      They desire to be the CEO of a multinational conglomerate, but they are
      scared to admit it because they think they may never get there since they
      do not have what it will take to get there.</p>
    <p class="article">Do not be bitten by such bugs. Do not let the greatness of your dream, or
      the enormity of the effort involved in transforming your third class
      degree to a first class testimony scare you away from giving it a trial.
      Always be willing to make an attempt first.</p>
    <p class="article">A good way to unmask the scary face of this giant dream is by reducing it
      to smaller dreams. Just like a man faced with a task of carrying a cart
      full of cartons up a number of stairs. What he does is to off-load it and
      carry it bits by bits until he has successfully transferred all the
      cartons and the cart to the last step of the stairs. This is how to handle
      a big dream.</p>
    <p class="article">Break the big dream into smaller tasks that can be accomplished in a
      reasonable amount of time. Break down your long-term vision into smaller
      and easily achievable short-term visions.</p>
    <p class="article">Replace the big ‘mountain’ with smaller ‘hills’ and transform each of the
      smaller ‘hills’ into a set of ‘molehills’ which can be crossed with a
      stretch of the leg. Break down large chunks of the dreams into smaller
      chunks and the smaller chunks into tiny pieces.</p>
    <p class="article">Divide the dream over a number of years. Further break it down into
      simpler units by dividing each year’s dream into twelve pieces: each part
      for a month. But try as much as possible to make each month’s allocation
      both achievable and realistic so as not to put yourself in a tight corner.</p>
    <p class="article">Further break the monthly goals into weekly goals, and the weekly goals
      probably into daily goals. Make each day count in the pursuance of your
      dream. Try to eliminate every unnecessary step (this should have been
      catered for at the goal setting and planning stage if you had really done
      what is expected of you).</p>
    <p class="article">The great burden of your dream becomes easier when you do it this way,
      splitting it into smaller accomplishable portions. It makes your seemingly
      mountainous dream become levelled grounds which you can walk over with
      ease.</p>
    <p class="article">Maximum results gotten through minimum efforts are what you should crave
      for in this pursuit of a first class life, and it can only be accomplished
      by breaking down your dream.</p>
    <p class="article">The final success of your dream depends on the successful accomplishment
      of each smaller units to which your big dream has been divided. Daily
      successes lead to weekly success. Weekly successes transform into monthly
      success. Monthly successes merge together to form annual success, which in
      turn opens the way for the successful accomplishment of the dream.</p>
