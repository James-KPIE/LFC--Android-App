	<h4 style="color:red" align="right">CHAPTER 4: Page 2</h4>
	<p class="article">Secondly, dreams are also often not inherited. They are not necessarily
      passed from parents to children, nor derived from family achievements.
      Very few people succeed on their parent’s dream as much as they do on
      their own dreams. They just manage to get along. Each person on earth
      needs to have his own dream. Any dream passed down to you through parents,
      friends, relatives, and neighbours stand to cause a division
      between you and them when the dream grows big.</p>
    <p class="article">Thirdly, dream is limited to no one in the secular. Everybody can dream -
      the rich and the poor; the white and the black; the big shots and the
      downtrodden; the educated and the illiterates; the males and the females;
      the old and the young; every one must have a dream, and more importantly,
      see to it that the dream comes to pass. It is your responsibility. Nobody
      will do it for you.</p>
    <p class="article">So many graduates are still waiting on God to give them a heavenly dream
      that will save them from the nationwide-invested-peril of unemployment,
      when in fact God is waiting for them to work on the ones He has deposited
      into their hearts. It is often noted that these ones are the indolent ones
      who do not want to do anything and are only using God as an excuse. This
      is the same reason why they failed out of school - indolence, laziness,
      nonchalance, and procrastination. It is time for such to change.</p>
    <p class="article">You have waited long enough for the Holy Spirit. If you think He has not
      given you one, then be proactive. Give yourself a dream. Keep working on
      that until He deems it fit to give you one.</p>
    <p class="article">Never forget this - home or abroad, never for once be without a dream or
      an important goal that you are working on. It is your first step in living
      a first class life with a third class certificate.</p>
    <p class="article"><b>DREAM BIG</b></p>
    <p class="article">Truly, dreams differ with each person. Many have no dreams, some have
      little dreams, and very few have big dreams, these last set of people
      shine brightest on earth. Strive to be among these few for they control
      the affairs of the world.</p>
    <p class="article">Uncommon achievements are made through uncommon dreams. A second class
      dream cannot yield a first-class result. You may not have a first-class
      result in school, but you can have a first-class dream in life and only
      this first-class dream will guarantee you a first-class placement among
      your friends with a first-class academic result later on in life.</p>
    <p class="article">Great dreams are the raw materials for great destiny. If only you can
      have a dream that is beyond others’ comprehension, then you are on your
      way to soaring to an enviable height.</p>
    <p class="article">Despite your result, do not either consciously or unconsciously plan to
      be less than you are capable of being. Always long to do something larger
      and bigger. Get a big dream. Explore new areas. Develop new techniques.</p>
    <p class="article">The secret of greatness is either in doing what has never been done
      before, or doing what has been done before in a way it has never been done
      before. To become an extra ordinary personality in life, you will have to
      go for extra ordinary dreams early enough. If you dream about what others
      have dreamt about, you are doing no new thing. It is better for you to do
      what others will not do, or at worst, do what others will do, but in a way
      they would not think of.</p>
    <p class="article">If your dream is small, you will forever remain small because your small
      dream will not produce a large future. Cats do not give birth to tigers.
      Lizards do not grow into crocodiles, and bats do not become eagles.</p>
